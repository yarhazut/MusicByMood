This place I enter seems so different from mine 
Sounds that words cannot explain 
My mind guides me through this light 
I am no longer a creature of this earth 
Shadows from Beyond, shine your light on me 
Shadows from beyond, give me rest and peace 
Shadows from Beyond, lift my spirits high 
Shadows from Beyond, let my demons fly 
Feelings of remorse and anger are gone 
The light carries the lost souls of night 
My eyes are amazed at your sight 
Command of your beauty goes right through me 
Shadows from Beyond, shine your light on me 
Shadows from beyond, give me rest and peace 
Shadows from Beyond, lift my spirits high 
Shadows from Beyond, let my demons fly 
Places of wisdom are unknown 
My suffering shall come to an end 
The fate of me rests in your mind 
My forces soar through all darkness 
Scriptures told of a new beginning 
Coming to accept the reality 
That this is only the end 
I can see my past and my enemies 
That lets me know that I'm alright 
My legacy will always live on 
Your shadows will prevent
