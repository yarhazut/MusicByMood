The winter eve breathes silently 
And the wind whispers through the trees 
A silent omen to beckon me 
Back to the place where we were strong 
But I cannot turn back to face you 
So I walk alone through desolation 
Holding the burden with feeble arms 
I will never let go of our past 
Breathlessly I struggle to find my peace of mind 
Desperately I struggle to find what's been left behind 
Through the raging darkness 
I am deaf to the omen that whispers 
"Tragedy is upon the one" 
"Who attempts to comfort his past" 
I am alone, but you are by my side 
I carry our past in memories 
As the darkness envelopes 
And shrouds me into this cold hell 
Breathlessly I struggle to find my peace of mind 
Desperately I struggle to find what's been left behind 
My strength is done 
I have faded 
I am alone, I am alone 
Breathless, I'm dying 
All for the hope of bringing back what we had 
An image, a distant memory 
Will you ever come back to me? 
Breathlessly I struggle to find my peace of mind 
Desperately I struggle to find what's been left behind
