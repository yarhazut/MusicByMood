Awaken to silence 
Am I dead, or is it all a dream? 
Etched into stone 
Lies my name; dusty, unhallowed 
Can you hear me now 
Can you see me now 
What is this all about 
Where has my life gone 
Everything and everyone 
(All) existence unheard of 
Awakened beyond 
The gates of infinity 
Can you hear me now 
Can you see me now 
What is this all about 
Where has my life gone 
Unjustified, unserved 
A punishment not deserved 
Awakened from a slumber 
So peaceful and tranquil 
This is a nightmare 
I'm reliving the life 
I dreaded so much 
And honestly, its killing me 
Awakened - Awakened to silence 
This nightmare replays 
Every darkened moment 
A relapse of my life
