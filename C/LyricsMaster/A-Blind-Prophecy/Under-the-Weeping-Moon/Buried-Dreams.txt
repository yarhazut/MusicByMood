Control my destiny 
And take me away 
Eternal agony, I'm possessed 
Why did this happen to me 
Memories are forever forgotten 
Broken and weak I've failed 
Now matter how hard I try 
Everything dies in the end 
Come die with me 
Bring me back home 
Feel the pain I feel 
Buried Dreams 
In your pathetic world 
The blind follow the blind 
Enemies we will always be 
This means war 
Come die with me 
Bring me back home 
Feel the pain I feel 
Buried Dreams 
Shot down in flames 
Vengeance is the only answer 
It attacks me violently 
To only make me stronger 
Come die with me 
Bring me back home 
Feel the pain I feel 
Buried Dreams
