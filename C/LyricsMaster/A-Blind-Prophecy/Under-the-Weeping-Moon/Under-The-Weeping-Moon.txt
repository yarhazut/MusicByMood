A weak opinion from a weak mind 
Your lies bleed right through me 
Disguised in innocence 
I've carved your name in blood 
Again I've been betrayed 
I must walk alone 
Upon this blackened Earth 
And under the weeping moon 
Denial of judgment 
Stripped of all lies 
Breathing in a choke 
Under the bleeding skies 
Again I've been betrayed 
I must walk alone 
Upon this blackened earth 
Under the weeping moon 
Guilty of existence 
The night, she calls my name 
And in this dying place 
The air reeks of vengeance 
Again I've been betrayed 
I must walk alone 
Upon this bleeding earth 
Under the weeping moon
