Everyone you ever knew - a lie 
Everything you ever knew - a lie 
Everyone you ever saw - a lie 
You are eternally blind 
Breathe in the truth 
The fact you aren't real 
You were never real to begin with 
Breathe in the truth 
You're blind to what you see 
You have to fight to be free 
Everything you ever did - a lie 
Everyone you ever loved - a lie 
Everyone you ever hurt - a lie 
You're torn in two 
Breathe in the truth 
Your bodies crumpling down 
Pressured by existence 
Exhale the truth 
Your eyes are open now 
You'll fight and win 
You'll win. 
Fight 
Die 
Live to be free 
Fight 
Die 
And welcome to reality!
