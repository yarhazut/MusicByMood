Stars never shone so bright
It is the warmest night,
The warmest night in ages
My empty pockets don't make me feel I'm empty
Need no clock to know when and where to go
Too many sad songs
Left my throat and reached
Ears of far too many sad people
It's sad they liked them
It's sad I know so few happy ones
Time flows through the beds of my vains, I feel it
Need no clock to know when and where to go
Too many sad songs left my throat and reached ears of far too many sad people
It's sad they liked them it's sad I know so few happy ones
