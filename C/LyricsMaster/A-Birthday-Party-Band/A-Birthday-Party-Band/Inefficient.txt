I am incompetent, I'm inefficient, lacking in ability
Not good at elbowing my way through crowds, I'd rather stay in bed and sleep
I'm irresponsible, I change my mind too often to sign up with you
I am at war with clocks, I'm always late, sometimes I don't appear at all
I can produce no useful thing, I only play, I only sing
I can produce no useful thing, I only play, I only drink
All movies give me hangover, leave me with a sense of wasted time
Like all the jobs I had gave me hangover, made me feel like getting drunk
Hate universities, most of the time I unlearn what I learned at school
I cannot force myself to play their game, the game I am sure I'm bound to lose
I can produce no useful thing, I only play, I only sing
