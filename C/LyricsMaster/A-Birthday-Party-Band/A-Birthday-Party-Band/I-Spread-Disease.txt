Tell your beads
[Don't] ask me to swallow them like pills
I'm not ill
It's not my kind of medicine
Not my kind of medicine
Carry you cross
Until you puke your soul up and
Go to hell
You and your friends,
I'm not going there
Ain't going anywhere
Tell your wish
And find me dead
And find me dead
Under your christmass tree
You hate to breathe the same air with me
I spread disease
You hate to breathe the same air with me
I spread disease
