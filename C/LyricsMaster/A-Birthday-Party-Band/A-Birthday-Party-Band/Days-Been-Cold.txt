It doesn't make any sense
It doesn't make sense to me at all
Though I do my best
Try as I may, can't understand it
Was it long ago?
Was it at the hour of my birth
That sky cracked open and
Cold rain fell down on my head
Since then
Days been cold
Days been cold
The weatherman kept lying on and on
About the coming of spring
I couldn't stand his stupid jokes
I threw my TV
Off the balcony and drank my tea
Never felt so good before
I killed the weatherman
Now despair will bring you outside
Your coffin houses, coffee bars and and your cars
The promise of sunny days is my curse
I don't want to hear you make
Promises you can't fulfil
The temperature will rise
God will bring greenhouse effect to us
And we will dance
In pools of tears as sweet as lies
Death will reach out his suntanned hand to us
We will shake it with a sentimental smile
Days been cold
