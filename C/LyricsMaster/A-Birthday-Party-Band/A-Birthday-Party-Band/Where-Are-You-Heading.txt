Walking down the street
I can't help but think I am the happiest man alive
Seeing faces like shell craters
Wrecked hope in front of the coffee machine
Sleepily pouring coffee down her throat to get along, to move on
Where are you heading?
Did you ever ask yourself
Instead of asking those who don't have time to think?
Walking down the street I feel like an island in the ocean of despair
I'm getting submerged, I'm sinking
I surface and I look
Into eyes that look so empty
They avoid my gaze
When I want to stop and ask them
Where are you heading?
Did you ever ask yourself
Instead of asking those fdon't have time to think?
