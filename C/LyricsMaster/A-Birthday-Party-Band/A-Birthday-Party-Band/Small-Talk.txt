I met you on the street and asked you how things were going in your life
Everything is fine you work and have a nice new girlfriend her name is ann
At weekends you go party get drunk and dance all night you sleep where you fall
And virtually nothing has changed since we met last time five years ago
And me? I'm fine, I'm just fine, never been good at small talk, but I try
The weather's nice, and what else can I say,
Not to spoil your day?
I met you in the subway, we were going same way, what a coincidence
You said I didn't change a bit and I bit my tongue not to tell you you did
Time was going by so slowly, I was counting stops
You said you love traveling by subway 'cause you're everywhere on time
And me? I'm fine, I'm just fine, broke as always and days just pass me by
I fell in love, it felt like I fell down stairs
Blindfolded
Headfirst
