I'm gone, didn't leave any message
And didn't take my phone
I'm gone and will never be back
I ain't coming home
I'm gone and though you see me sleeping
Curled up in my bed
I'm not the person you had known
Long before I left
I went to the no man's land
I went to the no man's land
I went to the no man's land in my bed
I'm gone, didn't leave any message
Cause you wouldn't care to read it
Even if you would
You couldn't understand
Crowded streets won't swollow me
And spit my bones out by your feet
I won't love and won't expect anybody to love me
Don't wake me up I went to sleep
I went to the no man's land in my bed
