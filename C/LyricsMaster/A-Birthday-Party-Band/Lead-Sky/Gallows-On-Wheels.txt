What a lovely day, it's a perfect day
For a ride, we're going nowhere
On the gallows on wheels
Did you notice that
There are 24 halters hanging
From the ceiling in the bus number 3
And the driver says there is no love
There's gear and breaks and clutch
Count: 1 2 3 4 5 6
What a lovely day, it's a perfect da
For a ride, we're going nowhere
On the gallows on wheels
Yes, we're going nowhere
And we've never gone faster
Nobody has evers gone downhill that fast
And driver says there is no love
There's gears and breaks and clutch
So count: 1 2 3 4 5 6...
