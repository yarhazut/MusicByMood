Late hour, I'm late again
I missed the last train, I missed the last train
I'm the only one. on the platform
Who's neither homeless nor homesick
If I smoked, I would be somking now
But I quit, one month ago
It feels like I list a friend,
My late friends are my best friends
I'm not sure if I'm not dead it's been so long since
I felt alive, I think I died
Last night when she asked me if I was listening to her
I wasn't there
Late hour, I'm late again there's no one to tell me when
The next train, comes to take me to
A place where I can begin anew
I'm not sure if I'm not dead it's been so long since
I felt alive, I think I died
Last night when she asked me if I was listening to her
I wasn't there
