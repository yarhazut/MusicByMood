Sitting at the table,
I can't gather my thoughts
I'd like to tell what is on my mind
But it's not
Of any interest to you
And you're s beautiful
Arranging words
And putting sentences in the right
Order just to stumble over when I try
To tell you that you drive me mad
Words stuck in my throat, no I won't tell you now
I could write a letter but your door's next to mine
And it's not
Of any interest to you
Somebody get me out of here
