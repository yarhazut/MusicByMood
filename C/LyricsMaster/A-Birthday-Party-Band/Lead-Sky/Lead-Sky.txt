Lead sky's falling on your heads again
It's been a cetury since autumn came
I look back, can't recall anything
There's not much worth remembering
It's a mediucre tragedy
Without a tragic end
Without a tragic end
Passion dissolves in monotony
To which there is no end
To which there is no end
Lead sky's falling down on out heads
Lead sky's falling on our heads again
It's been a century since autumn camoe
I am pressed to the ground,
I'm pressed on every side
I look ahead and can't imagine anything
