Can't fit my dreams into a ballot box
No ballot box is big enough to contain them all
Can't keep my heads off what I want and what I want I can't afford
My stomach knows better than your charts what crisis means
Been living the crisis all my life
Almost got used to it
Bumming cigarettes
And crusing under my breath
I saw how you clean up
All the mess you've meade
Yeah, I saw you put broken cups back on the shelf
Yeah I saw you sweep under the rug all what was left
Ain't got a table in the VIP room in the brand new world
They are all booked by you
I don't really need it, I don't really care
Don't want to sit there when it falls apart, I don't want to be there
Diggin in the dumpster
And finding myself
I saw how you clean up
All the mess you made
Yeah, I saw you put broken cups back in the shelf
Yeah I saw you sweep under the rug all what was left
