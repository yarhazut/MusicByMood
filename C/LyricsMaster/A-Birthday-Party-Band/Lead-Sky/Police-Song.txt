Streets are empty,
Decent people are asleep
Only thieves are out now
Police are searching,
Police are searching me again
They think the can do what they want
Don't you treat me like a dog
Don't you treat me like a dog
Or I will bite your legs off
They say I've the right to
Remain silent when all I want to do is shout
Lamps bend over us it seems it's not enough
For justice to regain her sight
Don't you treat me like a dog
Don't you treat me like a dog
Or I will bite your legs off
