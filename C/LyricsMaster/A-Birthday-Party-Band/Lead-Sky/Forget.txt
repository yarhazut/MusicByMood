So you've been there and you diddn't like it
And now you wish you could move back in time
Wondering how you could get addicted
To a drug that just won't get you high
And it's getting dark
And you're getting drunk
Sitting in front
Of a mirror that has lipstick traces on it
Telling tales you'd like to forget
To forget...
So you've been there and you diddn't like it
Now you're back in it's even worse
Someone has stolen your straight jacket
In wich you felt so safe and warm
And it's getting dar
And you're getting drunk
Sitting in front
Of a mirror that has lipstick traces on it
Telling tales you'd like to forget
To forget...
