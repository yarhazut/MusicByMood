Don't look down, don't look down
Walk along the line
If you fix your eyes on the end
You won't fall down
Walk the rope, don't look down
Think about the end,
When you reach it you can rest
And then start again
Don't look down
Don't look down, don't look down
There's no safety net
Clench your theeth and move on steadily
Look straight ahead
And you sknow, you still have choive
You've always had
You can either walk the rope
Or hang from it's end
Don't look down
