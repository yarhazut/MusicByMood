I first saw you on the grass
Slightly shy inclosed by skies.
And I told my friend I think I'm in love.
Your skin was darkened by the sun,
Been bathing summer long.
And I found my troubles drained by starlets.
Could you tell?
Our house was small but beautiful.
Our pictures on the walls.
Remember how proud I looked as we turned it to bed that night.
Speech:
I've been thinking.
We are so good together.
Let us stay together forever.
I love you.
Let us.
So true.
Let us sleep in the same bed.
I love you too.
Speech:
I have done since?
I do not love you.
In fact I have not loved you for quite some time.
I just did not realize.
Sorry, let us stay friends.
