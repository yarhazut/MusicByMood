Razorblade smiles bleed my skin makes me hate to want you your standing so close jealousys burden my awakening your on fire dancing the night away dressed in red and looks that kill you're my endless sea of warm desires there is never enough ink to tell you how much I want you working my way in locked doors all I want is a shot at the best let me in those sheets and feel your body close to mine I just want one just one feeling just one moment alone with you let me sing you to sleep with nightmares and fairy tales I tell you your consuming all of me you're a devil in diguise and your the one I want to take home tonight you devil in diguise now your dead to me
