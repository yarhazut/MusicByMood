Can you forgive me for not dying soon enough it hurt me so much to hear your voice it hurt you so much to hear me scream bleed nothing I've bled so many tears to bleed nothing at all I just want to stop breathing now we are living for nothing and dying for everything so this is your gift to me your love I won't soon forget leave me in the autumn leaves on an octobers sunset let them find me bound and still I will hold it close I was dead set on dying slow shutter looking back at my own cold reflection pouring pitch black from the gates of my heart in to the dark I am left in pieces now leave me in the autumn leaves on an octobers sunset let them find me bound and still you were my elegant assassin I will hold you close I could never let you go
