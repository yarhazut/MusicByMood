Caress my dear 
The fire is hunting our ghosts 
Find this newborn to care 
All life leads to dust 
Rise just to fall once again 
Until we die - we fall and suffer in fear 
We cry in the light of a new dawn 
In this world - we fail - to rise 
Unwillingly thrown - in this - this life 
We try to find - a path - a sign 
But we're doomed - we're doomed - to die 
So descend - to life - resist - defy 
In our pain - we try - in vain 
To become one - to grow - to gain 
We try to find - a path - a sign 
But we're doomed - we're doomed - to die 
So return - to light - embrace - revive
