Each night I sing you to sleep
But you never sleep, because you
Stay awake with me
I'll take the long way home just to be alone
With my thoughts of you
We sat for hours, out on your roof
And in your room, and I promised
I would think of you
Each night I sing you to sleep
But you never sleep, because you
Stay awake with me
You never sleep
You never sleep
I'll count the stars until I'm where you are
Because sleeping never did me any
Good any way
Each night I sing you to sleep
But you never sleep, because you
Stay awake with me
You never sleep
You never sleep
You're the only one that I want to call
At midnight to say sleep well
You're the only one that scares me of
Myself, I think, I know I'm falling for you
