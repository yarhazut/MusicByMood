Stay the night, and tomorrow,
We're the same as before,
Riding high, let's say good bye to,
Every wrong that we've tried to right,
Let's say good bye to,
Every wrong that we've tried to right
Nineteen years, seems way too long,
To wait again, for you to find me,
I've no more tears, I'm empty and tapped out
I'm so lonely, and so are my arms,
Now I have some room inside my heart,
For you, for me, to finally make up,
I'll buy your make up,
Let's say good bye to,
Every wrong that we've tried to right,
Let's say good bye to,
Every wrong that we've tried to right
Nineteen years, seems way too long,
To wait again, for you to find me,
I've no more tears, I'm empty and tapped out
Can I borrow some of yours,
Some more, of you?
