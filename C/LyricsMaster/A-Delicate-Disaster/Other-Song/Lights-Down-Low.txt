If only a promise tonight wouldn't end,
With kisses that are suffocating me,
It seems like the air that is shared with you,
Is temporary, at least for tonight it's mine
Closer and closer she's moving I'm dreaming,
She's leaving me now
With the lights down low, and all we know,
This might be our last night here
She's classy and passing me notes,
But I just walk on, because It can't be me,
That she dreams about
Closer and closer she's moving I'm dreaming,
She's leaving me now
With the lights down low, and all we know,
This might be our last night here
And all I'd give, and all I'd lose,
To spend one night right here with you,
And all of this, was all of your fault,
You never felt the way I do
