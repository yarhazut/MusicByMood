The stars are out I see,
Your reflection as they gleam,
The night with fresh new air,
As the moon has a cast a stare over me,
Nostalgia fades away, fades away,
But you don't
Take me back to a place,
When nothing else mattered,
So I won't cry myself to sleep,
The night is passing and,
Leaving me lasting memories of,
Tonight is over
Nostalgia fades away, fades away,
But you don't
