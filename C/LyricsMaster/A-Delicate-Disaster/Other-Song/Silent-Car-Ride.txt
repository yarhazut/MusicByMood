Instead of pointing fingers, we should be holding hands,
Because this is more than I can stand,
If we are choosing battles, I'll just give up the war,
And save us from regret
Silent car rides leave us hoping for a destination,
Save your sad sighs for a sad time,
Awkward silence almost seems quite bearable,
For me at least I'm fine
I know you never meant to be, so cold when I reached
For your hand,
Temperature outside is cutting off the air that could
Be shared with you
Silent car rides leave us hoping for a destination,
Save your sad sighs for a sad time,
Awkward silence almost seems quite bearable,
For me at least I'm fine
