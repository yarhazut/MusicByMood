I call you when I get home just to say,
Our first kiss was worth waiting for,
My goose bumps are receding and I,
Am left with feeling you inside my arms,
You've figured me out, you've figured me out,
That's okay because I wanted you to,
You've figured me out, you've figured me out,
That's okay because I wanted you to
Nancy drew, she doesn't have a thing on you,
Because you dug into the heart of me,
So please don't retreat because I can never be the same,
Without you telling me about your day
I miss you and cuddling so close it hurts,
To think that I have to wait to to talk to her,
Tomorrow we'll move your bed back to where,
It needs to be
You've figured me out, you've figured me out,
That's okay because I wanted you to,
You've figured me out, you've figured me out,
That's okay because I wanted you to
Nancy drew, she doesn't have a thing on you,
Because you dug into the heart of me,
So please don't retreat because I can never be the same,
Without you telling me about your day
