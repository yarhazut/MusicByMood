You saw me hiding under,
10,000 broken hearts you found today,
You never spoke up, never said a word,
When I cried out, "Come and save me."
Maybe I'm just scared of being burnt,
Like so many times before,
So please forgive me if my sensitivity is lacking,
But you are my four leaf clover,
And when my day is much darker than others,
You'll hold me close, for a rainy day
You surround me all the time,
But please forgive me for sounding clich√©,
I'm sure that you're tired,
But you feel from heaven into my arms
And this time I'll hold on
But you are my four leaf clover,
And when my day is much darker than others,
You'll hold me close
I'll find the courage to tell you hello,
And you'll find the time to tell me hi,
And as I walk away from meeting you,
You're planning the rest of our lives
