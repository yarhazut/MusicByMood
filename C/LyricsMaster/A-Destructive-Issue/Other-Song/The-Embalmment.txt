Lies that offer closure,
Leaves this fake exposure
Eyes, that never follow time
Give me cocaine pleasures, for a better measure.
I can't take this biting line...
Spit it out spit, spit it out spit!,
Take it out, take, take it out, fake!
And I will be here waiting, and we will be here waiting,
Let the life of the words come alive unrehearsed
I won't let go...
Taste the tongue of pleasure, keep it there forever
Stiched, into our bloodshot eyes
Fake, the raging seizure is this burning fever
Lost, forever in too minds.
