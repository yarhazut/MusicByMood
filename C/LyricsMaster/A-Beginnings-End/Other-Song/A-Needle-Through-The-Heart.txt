This ignorance is catching up with me
Dragging me down, disrupting my thoughts constantly
I'm sick of these games, I don't know what to do
I'll somehow find that way to disappoint you
(Like a needle through the heart) It hurts me so bad
(Like a needle through the heart) I can't take this anymore
(Like a needle through the heart) It's almost over now
Is this all one big joke to you?
Is that all this is just one big game?
(Like a needle through the heart) It hurts me so bad
(Like a needle through the heart) I can't take this anymore
(Like a needle through the heart) It's almost over now
(Like a needle through the heart) It's all over now
