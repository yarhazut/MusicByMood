With this blade in hand
I think of everything I can't understand
I wanna take the next step
But my fears catch up with me
Put it slowly to the ground
I realize I'm safe and sound
This can only happen in my deep sleep
Only in my dreams
You're probably discusted by now, I know
Just understand that I'm nothing like you
Be more open minded
And listen to what I have to say, its ok.
Listen to these sick thoughts
They're only in my dreams
Why am I like this?
Don't forget they're only dreams.
You're probably discusted by now, I know
Just understand that I'm nothing like you
Be more open minded
And listen to what I have to say, its ok.
Why am I like this? They're only dreams
Why am I like this? They're only dreams
Why am I like this? They're only dreams
Why am I like this? They're only dreams...
