(Unknown Screaming)
Engulfed in the flames,
While I'm screaming your name,
Can you hear me this last time?
Gasoline sunsets,
Wake us from our rest
As the darkest sky ignites.

Engulfed in the flames,
While I'm screaming your name,
Can you hear me this last time?
Gasoline sunsets,
Wake us from our rest,
As the darkest sky ignites.
(Unknown Screaming)
Cross my heart,
And hope to die,
With the gasoline sunset lighting up the sky. [x7]
Cross my heart,
And hope to die,
With the gasoline sunset lighting up the sky,
Tonight...
