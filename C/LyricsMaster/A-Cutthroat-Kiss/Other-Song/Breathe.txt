Don't say goodbye
Is what I begged that night
And every tear you cry is what makes me die
So don't let me die, I won't let you cry tonight
Breathe this life away from me
A breath away will always be
How you you and me will always be
Take my last breath it's your to keep
And when I fall from the rooftops above
I'll spread warmth to the ground with my love and my blood
And no one will notice that I'm gone
But deep down inside, I hoped that I was wrong
Breathe this life away from me
A breath away will always be
How you you and me will always be
Take my last breath it's your to keep
With a gun in her hand she's my shooting star...
Breathe this life away from me
A breath away will always be
How you you and me will always be
Take my last breath it's your to keep
