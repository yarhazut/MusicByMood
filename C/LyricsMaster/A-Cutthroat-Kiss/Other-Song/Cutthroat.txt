Take your eyes and see me now
Before I take what you took of me
Lay my head on bloodless hands tonight
Drown in tears the clear but poison wine
Well I need what you owe
Will you pay me back in bandaged covered wrists
Don't you know
The feeling of a cutthroat lover's kiss
Please don't go
Breaking other hearts just like this, just like this
'Cause I'm the only one who sees you in the darkness of the night
And even though we're distant, I dream of you despite,
The sickle in between us, that ruins and divides
And even though you're gone I'll love you all of my life.
