And I looked
I looked up at the stars
And found the brightest pair
The ones I could compare
To your eyes and then
As nightfall turned to day
I watched them fade away
As nightfall turned to day
I watched you fade away
Never will I
Let go of what I love
And what she means to me
The reason I can't sleep
Is the reason I miss her
It's a feeling that no words
Will never be enough
Will never be enough
Will never be enough
Another lonely night
Without her by my side
Take all that I am
I'm wishing you goodnight
Another lonely night
Without her by my side
Take all that I am
I'm wishing you goodnight
43 minutes past one
Do you remember that time
I'll give you all that I have
I'll give you all that is mine
I'll keep my promise sincere
I'll keep the thought of you near
I'll be there every time
Just like the shine of your eyes
Another lonely night
Without her by my side
Take all that I am
I'm wishing you goodnight
Another lonely night
Without her by my side
Take all that I am
I'm wishing you goodnight
