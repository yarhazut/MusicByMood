I'll cut an X over my heart 
Blood drips from the corners of the room. 
As these walls scream imperfections through 
Torn flesh and broken bones 
Then you'll ask me what have I done 
Tell me what havent you done if 
Guilty lips are not so innocent 
A bullet with your name right through my chest proving love was worth dying for 
A bullet with your name right through my chest proving love was worth dying for 
Tear those wings right off your back 
And innocence is what you lack 
And when the trail leads back to me 
Apologies are all the same 
And this is how we play the game 
Show me a new way to bleed 
A bullet with your name right through my chest proving love was worth dying for. 
A bullet with your name right through my chest proving love was worth dying for. 
A bullet with your name right through my chest proving love was worth dying for. 
A bullet with your name right through my chest proving love was worth dying for.
