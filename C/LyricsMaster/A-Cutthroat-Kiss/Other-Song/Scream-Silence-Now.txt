It's far past the nightfall
And we're still awake
You whispered to me a sweet serenade
Bloodshot eyes never cry
Courageous hearts never die
Scream silence now
I've always been listening to cries so deafening
From the bottom, from the bottom of my heart and the top of my lungs
If I can lose my voice, I'd lose is just for you
This blanket, I tore it apart
Just so you know that I'd keep you warm
Bloodshot eyes never cry
Courageous hearts never die
Scream silence now
I've always been listening to cries so deafening
From the bottom, from the bottom of my heart and the top of my lungs
If I can lose my voice, I'd lose is just for you
The air I breathe tonight is stopping at my lungs
The air I breathe tonight is stopping at my lungs
Like the words we say are stopping at our lips
At our lips...
