Like kings and queens we dance! 
To keep this night alive. 
Honestly we're just too modest. 
Full blooded friends, don't break your promise. 
You don't Have to be blood to be family. 
Wake up to all the town. 
Its way to late but were still down. 
Its way to late but were still down.
Dance with me.
This will be the sound of children 
Shouting that we're always asking for. 
We play for keeps in this game of loss. 
We love to laugh and laugh and love. 
We dance to show them what kings and queens are made of. 
Sing every love with no regrets. 
There's not time that could be better spent. 
We thought this out. 
Honestly we're just too modest
Full blooded friends, don't break your promise. 
You don't have to be blood to me family.
Wake up to all the town. 
It's way to late but were still down. 
It's way to late but were still down. 
Why can't we all just sing along? 
Why can't we all just sing along? 
Why can't we all just sing along? 
Why can't we? 
Why can't we?
