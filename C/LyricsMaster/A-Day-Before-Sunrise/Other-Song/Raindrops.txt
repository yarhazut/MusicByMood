We should find new love
Without saying it through our teeths
New love new arts just feel it deep
Inside we are closer than we are
Just take it like a friend
Somehow too close to feel
Too far away... (we move to slow)
Too far away... (we move to slow)
A better place to be
More than twelve hours to sleep
Watching raindrops falling 
Watching raindrops crashing in our heart
Too far away...(we move to slow)
Too far away...(we move to slow
