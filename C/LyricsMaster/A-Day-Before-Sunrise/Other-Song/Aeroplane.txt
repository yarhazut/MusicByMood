I never thought its gone
The times we shared together
We used some other words
Some words that signed the future
But now its dark cold
And we all are moving home
And what if we are still the same
Moving backward turn
Another day for you
Follow our feelings
And wash away the shame we had
These are the horses inside my heart
These are the horses who keep calling me
