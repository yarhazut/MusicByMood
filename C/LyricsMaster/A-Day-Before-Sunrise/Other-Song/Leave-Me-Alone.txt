For me its leaving
For you its just a stupid game
So let me walk across the wall
And the I try to fall asleep
But you alwys wake me up
My pillow is sweaty from my dreams
Just two steps back (to find another start)
Just two steps back (to find new shoes)
Leave me alone
Don't'hold my feet
Leave me alone
Don't feel like walking on my hands
Leave me alone 
Don't have the money to pay
Leave me alone...
