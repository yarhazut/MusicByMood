The music is dying all over
We need our ears to hear
Some voices are over a heartbeat
These beats are giving me 
The rest I ever need
If you find your lost point
Turn on the radio
Listen to their lyrics and you find...
Follow these memories and close your eyes
Not tomorrow is what they bring you today.
I don't destroy me television at all
But the music is better.
