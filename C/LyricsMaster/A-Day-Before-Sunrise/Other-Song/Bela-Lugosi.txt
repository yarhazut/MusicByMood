I realized that I don't exist to live
A life in my own way
A life without beginners luck
Look at daniel he just wants to fight
Without some rules and pain
Without some teacher by his side
We are different but we are all the same
Look at me I'm not a superhero
I don't like when someone watch up
To another human side
I hope you feel when we are close
Together that I'm not a shitface
That I tried to be a helping hand
We are different but we are all the same
