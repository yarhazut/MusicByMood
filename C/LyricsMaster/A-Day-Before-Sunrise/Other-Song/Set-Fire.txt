We take one step for another
We never going to lose our ways
We never thought that it could change
Our lives nothing is too far away
We try to set fire to those ships
We burned the ships who leaving town
We break the walls, the ones that are
Too high we break ourself inside
We should keep the small
I'm still running away from now
I'm still running away from then
Why we don't find any new letters
With scripts inside that shows our life
We are not blind we are not stupid
We all take a ride inside...
