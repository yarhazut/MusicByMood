As I look back, my murky past
Looks black, but I know nothing I can do about it
I tried to can some memories, but jealousy
Just creeps back into my mind
I work all day, I drink all night
My life is just an angry blur
As I was waiting for the fare on the way home, I saw man get stabbed
He made no mess and made no fuss
The all night party just goes on
And on, and on, and on, and on
The all night party goes on
