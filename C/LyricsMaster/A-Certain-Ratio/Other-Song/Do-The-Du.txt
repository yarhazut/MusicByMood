My heart was just an open sore
Which you picked at 'til it was raw
It bled away my existence
Shriveled under your insistence
You forced me to my deadly fate
Turned me into a thing of hate
I flayed your flesh with my thoughts
I flayed your flesh with my thoughts
Your fate transforms
In the hope that I could conform
For a moment
I flayed your flesh with insistence
I drew your blood with consistence
I flayed your flesh with insistence
I drew your blood with consistence
