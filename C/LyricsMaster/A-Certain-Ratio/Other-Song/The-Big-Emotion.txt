When you're sick and tired of everybody lying to you 
You just want to walk away, walk right into better days 
If you can just stop wanting it, it will come to you 
I know you try, but don't try to hard 
When I see you cry, it breaks my heart 
I won't stop loving you, I still believe in you 
When everything goes wrong, you think you're on your own 
I won't stop loving you, I won't stop loving you 
In this changing times, you see yourself on the outside 
It's getting harder to find your way 
You're living in hope from day to day 
If you can laugh in spite of it, there's nothing you can't do 
I know you try, but don't try to hard 
When you lie to me, you break my heart 
I won't stop loving you, I still believe in you 
When everything goes wrong, you think you're on your own 
I won't stop loving you, I won't stop loving you 
You just can't take it anymore, and then again 
A lost cause is the only one worth fighting for!
I won't stop loving you, I still believe in you 
When everything goes wrong, you think you're on your own 
I won't stop loving you, I won't stop loving you
