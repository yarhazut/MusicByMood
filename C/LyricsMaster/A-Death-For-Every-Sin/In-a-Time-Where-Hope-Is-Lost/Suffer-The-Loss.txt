Fuck you, you created this face and this misery.
Something once my saving grave is now a bitter memory.
Searching for answers to questions I shouldn't ask.
Just know I'll always hate you for what you've fucking done.
Why must beauty always die in these callous hands?
Feels like I will forever walk this path alone.
All the things I've once held close to my heart are now gone.
Feeling empty I've lost all fucking will to gain back what I lost,
What you took away.
I'll always hate you for what,
For what you've fucking done.
The more I try to make sense of this,
The less I comprehend.
