Forever gone, suffer in deception as you learn the hardest truth.
After all the confusion nothing seems familiar.
What has been broken for so long can never be the same.
This is how it will be until the day I die.
I can't turn back from here.
How can I save myself with one foot in the grave?
I wish I didn't know the things I fuckin' know.
What has been broken for so long can never be the same.
