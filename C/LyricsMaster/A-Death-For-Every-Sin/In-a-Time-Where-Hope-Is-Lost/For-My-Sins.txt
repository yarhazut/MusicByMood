In a time where hope is lost,
I have sworn myself, never follow the lost souls.
Walking this shattered world, prophecizing a bitter end.
I won't bow down to them or their god.
All your righteous words.
They were never for me.
All your righteous words, they were never for me.
All your righteous lies, they were never for me.
They won't change me, I live for myself.
Talking of redemption when no one died for my sins.
I see your faith for what it truly is.
All your righteous words, they were never for me.
All your righteous lies, they were never for me.
They won't change me, I live for myself. fuck you!
I've watched you fall from grace.
No one died for my sins.
