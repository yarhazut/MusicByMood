Life is hard when it has no meaning.
I've never felt so low.
No one to blame out but myself,
So now I have to make things right.
If not, I'll just sink deeper towards the bottom.
Where did it all go wrong?
I have forgotten when.
I'm always failing the trials I'm face with.
I just hope that these tortured days will have an end.
I'd give anything to forget the thoughts that plague me.
What do you do when you want to forget a broken past?
Fucking up is how your learn, I know, I've been here before.
But when the truth lays out before you, it has you dying cold.
Searching for a way out, I can't let this last forever.
Now I will confront what I've fought with for so long.
