I've failed in love again.
Will I ever win?
All the pain and suffering.
Born to lose, accept my fate.
Looking back I hate myself for the scars I've left.
I have become my nightmares, I have become my fears.
Everything I've touched has rot away.
Can I redeem myself for the pain I've caused?
Filled with regrets, my heart in my hands.
To love is to lose, to hope is to die,
In the end I've lost everything I had.
I live this life with guilt in my heart.
