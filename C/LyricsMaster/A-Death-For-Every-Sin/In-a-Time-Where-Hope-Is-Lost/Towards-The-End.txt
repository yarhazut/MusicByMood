Devoid of truth, we swallow our own lies.
And keep believing that this life is worth pursuing.
Thrown into a world where no light shall ever shine.
Condemned to a meaningless future, we live to die.
This life has been raped. now it's too late.
Fuck this world for what it is.
We were mislead by faith.
Fuck this world for what it is, we were mislead by lies.
Everyday is another nail in the coffin of our molded lives.
Every prayer said in vain is one more breath closer to death.
