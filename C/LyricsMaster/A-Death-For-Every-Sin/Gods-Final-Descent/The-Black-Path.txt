Progress is the death of hopes of harmony
A dreadful fate awaits extinction of this dying world decaying culture obsessed
With itself unable to stray from its path this vile creation digs its own
Grave bastard kingdom shall tumble down watch your false savior bathe...
In his own filth no hope for this world destined to suffer
Our faith is sealed well burn in this hell the blackpath
Will be our last sin it will be our last sin.
Our last sin.
