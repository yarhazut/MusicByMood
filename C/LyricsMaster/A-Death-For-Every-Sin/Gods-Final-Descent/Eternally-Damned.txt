Ostracized by the disciples of a dark empire
By deamons dressed in white staying the infidels
Spreading lies bringers of death and horror
Quenching their sadistic thirst for blood a quest that made
This land a mass grave still the chorus of pleas and remain
Unheard demanding justice for the crimes committed
Against their people for the memories of those mourned they
Shall seek vengeance retribution for the martyrs of this world
Vengeance now judgement's coming pray for the last time and gasp for your last breath.
