We are born alone damned and frail searching to lift
This curse of despair a cureless disease that bring only pain to those that have been betrayed
And scarred left devoid of love another desecrated soul now walks this earth suffering
And dying in loneless all that is left memories,
Lost innocent all that is left stripped of life those left behind have nothing
But their shattered hopes and broken dreams
All that is left memories,
Lost innocent all that is left...
Are these bleeding wounds of despair relinquish in sadness.
