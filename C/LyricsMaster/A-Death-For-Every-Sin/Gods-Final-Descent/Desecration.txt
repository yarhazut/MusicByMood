Deconstruct their lies their ideas of love and sin
Norms prescribed by moral whores and reinforced
By sick masters architects of abberation cut their
Throats make them bleed the false gods are now
Naked burn this dogma down burn it down ascension
Beyond and above their hymns of lies and deceit
Bloodstain myth molded by deceivers and believers
Desecrate this holy ground kill the masters of lies let
Them drown in their blood withness their demise drown in your blood.
