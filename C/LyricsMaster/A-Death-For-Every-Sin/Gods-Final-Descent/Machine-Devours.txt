Unholy crusades pursued by legions of prophets
Chanting the graces of this man-made cage glorifying
Slavery so kneel before the altar of the new gods and pray for salvation bring forth
All the idols of hell and filth banish them from this world for
Blasphemous deeds untold or the prophets of false hope
Will lead this world to its end breeders of pain takers of life
The time as come for redemption
