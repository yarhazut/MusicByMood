Burn their gods this false legacy
I won't celebrate faceless icons painted black
Bane of the deranged distorted images...
Abominations treacherous portrait of truth callous
Throne of the wicked destined to rust and decay
Dehumanized existence is worthless kill
The will of the father for it is soiled with the blood
Of its victims innocents doomed and misled from the
Beginning by vicars of sickness under a godless sky
We're left to rot and to die I won't celebrate faceless icons painted black.
