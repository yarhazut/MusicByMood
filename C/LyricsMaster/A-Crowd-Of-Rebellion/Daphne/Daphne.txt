What would you see from your little eyes?
Someone for you goes, it's colorless
And when I leave you, then will I take color away from you?
Is it cold or hot or nothingï¼Ÿ
Like a garbage on the Friday
Fear ending
I can only pray
Then where do I go after the end?
I maybe like to know but maybe I do not
Somehow I know it's cruel
Alone, Alone
Facing the ending
Alone, Alone
Falling to unending hole
May my piece would stay for someone in this world
Is it cold or hot or nothing?
Like a garbage on the Friday
Then where do you go who is here now?
We were born and we started to cry
Why? cause know the ending?
And you have known the answer
I try to know what I don't know
We are walking on a road each torch to each heart
Good bye and farewell
Alone, Alone
Facing the ending
Alone, Alone
Falling to unending hole
May my piece would stay for someone in this world
I do believe, person like me
A time to say long time no see and walk by your side
Alone, Alone
Facing the ending
Alone, Alone
Falling to unending hole
May my piece would stay for someone in this world
There is no lie or truth in heart of belief
