Chain of death never dies
Isn't is enough?
I'm boring with this friend role-playing game
Where is the clear voice?
Black anthem never stops
You and me, no expectations
Your favorite star is drinking honeydew
Where are we going?
We are falling together
I'm just like a machine
I thought I grabbed the liberty but...
Where are you going?
We are dancing like puppets
I'm just like a machine
暴かれた　仮面の裏
蔑みと　堕落の手
泣き真似が　羽音の様
まやかし　乱立
刷り込まれ　煙に巻かれ
蹂躙される　ハリボテは
病みもせず　苦にもせず
白いまま　腐ってく
Chain of death never dies
"I mustn't be here"
Then where am I going?
I always here the voice
I do not stop here
I always here the voice
暴かれた　仮面の裏
蔑みと　堕落の手
泣き真似が　羽音の様
まやかし　乱立
刷り込まれ　煙に巻かれ
蹂躙される　ハリボテは
白いまま　眠る
It's such a damn world
Do what you want
You agree?
You can't take it if other one's the one
Someone help me
I'm will lose myself
No one can save me tonight
They say that there's no number one
But we try to be the one
I choose to shine and die as I want
笑い合った　仮面の裏
蔑みと　堕落の手
泣き真似が　羽音の様
まやかし　乱立
刷り込まれ　煙に巻かれ
蹂躙される　ハリボテは
病みもせず　苦にもせず
白いまま　眠る
Where is the clear voice?
Black anthem never stops
勝手な神託を 睨む
Where is the clear voice?
Black anthem never stops
消えろ　面倒な光、
生り止まぬ　倍化。
