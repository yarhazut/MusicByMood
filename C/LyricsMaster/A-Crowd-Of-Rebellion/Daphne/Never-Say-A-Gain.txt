When the outer war is over, a war inside start
When does it end?
"When you die." someone said
Open up the glittering treasure box
You'll face the real life front of you
Turtle's watching
Golden smokes kill your heart
Never tell me again
Then you have gone
May you please do not lose
Enemy hiding in the smoke
We fight against the telephone pole
Open your eyes
There's a sweet trap there
You'd better pretend to be a shit
But you must hide your sharp fang for now
Everyone surely find the clime
Cutting down killed our will and soul
You have said that you couldn't pay
Knowing but mistake
Give it back
If you bet on yourself and threw yourself
Just keep holding yourself just like that
Never tell me again. Then you have gone
We couldn't believe them anymore
One day they get us with mirage
Recipe on the desk
Like a heartless love letter left for us
Serious side effect on the "Azami"
君は何を残すの
不完全な僕らに
君は何を残すの
Everyone surely find the clime
Cutting down killed our will and soul
You have said that you couldn't pay
Knowing but mistake
Give it back
When the outer war is over, a war inside start
