Nobody knows what's the judgement
Don't think with your head, just dance, dance
"The story isn't only mine but yours, but it's..."
Dark, never ending, getting me, put my pen down
Those flowers bloom so sadly
Reach my two hands
I make a determination
Hey tonight, it's time to wake up yourself
Run away before get corrupt
絵画は笑う　また私を
「臆病者」と笑う　宵夢の中まで
So Judgement Day is coming
We go through the forbidden fate
Again you put me the shoes of glass
So throw the tiara with the bravery
Again you put me the shoes of glass
So throw the tiara and the blame
If you rip the darkness inside of me
I will throw everything tonight
Something you eager to reach
If you touch in a light and it goes away
We don't have time to stop and think
We don't have time to wait
I take it in the dark as I wish
Nobody in my way
絵画は笑う　また私を
「臆病者」と笑う　宵夢の中まで
So Judgement Day is coming
Again you put me the shoes of glass
So throw the tiara with the bravery
Again you put me the shoes of glass
So throw the tiara and the blame
If you rip the darkness inside of me
I will throw everything tonight
Goodnight past
Help, days dazzles my eyes
(You can't reach a piece if I stop moving)
I'm like a bird in a little cage
(N body knows the ending of the story of sadness)
Again you put me the shoes of glass
So throw the tiara with the bravery
Again you put me the shoes of glass
So throw the tiara and the blame
If you rip the darkness inside of me
I will throw everything tonight
