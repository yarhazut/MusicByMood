意味のないことなんてこの世界にないって君は言う
そう今夜も僕はときはなってカレル
Prize to be the one
The hundred millions
You must stay alive to be alive
What the fuck up? Our buddy is gone
They're swimming like hell in their own way
You say that there is no meaningless thing in this world
I release myself tonight again and die
Everything is gonna be alright
白き　叫び　始まり　告げる　競争
"What the fuck up? Our buddy is gone"
Your buddy is gone, you're sorry to be one
Is it a parade for a match or a death?
Who's next?
Prize to be the one
The hundred millions
You must stay alive to be alive
「鉄の城壁こじ開けろ」
Everything is gonna be alright
白き　叫び　始まり　告げる　競争
"What the fuck up? Our buddy is gone"
Your buddy is gone, you're sorry to be one
My will is to reach that is the land
We have no buddy on this small world from the day I was born
Everything is gonna be alright
白き　叫び　始まり　告げる　競争
"What the fuck up? Our buddy is gone"
Your buddy is gone, you're sorry to be one
