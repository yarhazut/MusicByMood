Oh, yes, yes, I know, I know it
I'll be there in a second to show how cool we are
Did you like it
Our Jutsu of change
All the play is over, fuck you, everyone
We send you this anger on COD
Shut up, can't you hear?
Give a girl and some drink
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, sorry
Let me sing a song with love
Why people hurt me every time
During my lifetime? Price isn't low isn't low
Well it's not that bad as I feel so get down
You can pretend to be a fool, let the parade goes on
Get up, then you make a like
Won't you please do what I said?
We are blind animals
Can I give you a receipt for that hurt of you?
Oh no? No? Let me deal with it
わかりますでも苦しいです
僕等は何時もギリギリギリ舞
Oh no? No? I know it
Let me try the best
Well do you know how are heart just look like?
Shut up, can't you hear?
Give a girl and some drink
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, sorry
Let me sing a song with love
Why people hurt me every time
During my lifetime? Price isn't low isn't low
Well it's not that bad as I feel so get down
You can pretend to be a fool, let the parade goes on
Get up, then you make a like
Won't you please do what I said?
Songs do harm, songs do harm
Blood pressure killing me now
Shout of the rage, shout of the rage
"Les Miserable"
Go crazy, go crazy
No one fucking care of you
Go fight, go fight
Won't you let us be excited?
Go crazy, go fight
大悟徹底　覆水　盆に返らず
そんな　冷たい　切ない
鉄　みたいに　なったの?
That's wrong
You can pretend to be a fool
Let's get it on
Why people hurt me every time
During my lifetime?
Price isn't low isn't low
Well it's not that bad as I feel so
Get down
You can pretend to be a fool let's get it on
