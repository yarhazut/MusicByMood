Don't be wrong
Open your eyes
Open your mind
Put the time back
The time you have given up
You've stop thinking
It's the time your fate saw the ending
It's game over when you give up coach said
Don't stop
Don't be afraid of thinking over
Don't stop
Just like breathing the air
The meaning doesn't matter if there is or not
Then you don't need this word
Then there is no meaning for this song
Can you hear useless anymore?
Ladies and gentlemen
You really really love your face
Ladies and gentlemen
Do you really see the world?
It's a party night, party night
Can't check your age
It's a party night, party night
Just to get laid
Wow
Wow
It's a party night, party night
Can't check your age
It's a party night, party night
Just to get laid
You are ugly geek can't get out of there
Now forget it
Leave it alone and come here
Let's have a fun time
Hey, there you are
You know what I mean
Don't guess wrong and would you close the mouth
I live my life as I wish
Know the meaning of the cost of it
I saw you falling down deep hole
With a chewing gum in my mouth
Give a great big hand to a splendid crashing
The prophet knows what is waiting
They were young but that was it
Waiting for the end? No, we keep thinking
We've finally understood
Ladies and gentlemen
You really really love your face
Ladies and gentlemen
Do you really see the world?
It's a party night, party night
Can't check your age
It's a party night, party night
Just to get laid
Wow
Wow
It's a Party night, party night
Can't check your age
It's a Party night, party night
Just to get laid
You are ugly geek can't get out of there
You're
Dick looked
Dickhead
Turtle in net
I guess I am going to fuck off now
You are ugly geek can't get out of there
