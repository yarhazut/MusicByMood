Far away we have come
No way to go back
Fantasy is gone now
One day we saw
Still they keep asking to me
"Take me to the end"
Don't look down
No one can ever forget
Choice we made
From that night you were always there
手を離れた愛を
簡単に葬ることができなくて
君の在り処を探してた
闇の間に間に間に間に堕ちてくようで
We shouldn't say good-bye
君の答えを探すため
ゆらり夜の果てにまた歩みだした
Well, would you save me when I need you?
I told you a fiction
Which will come true
And now they still say,"It's not the end"
Still yet
"I said "Allthat you have
Done is right"
But I'm not sure about it for now"
He scratched his head again. again
僕は変われない僕を救えるかな
Before the darkness break down my heart
旅に灯りを探してた
闇の間に間に間に間に堕ちてくようで
We shouldn't say good-bye
星の光を探すように
ゆらり夜の果てにまた歩みだした
If we must go with my wishes left here
We dare to cut my neck
酷く掠れた声でまた
振り返り僕を呼び答えを問いただすんだろ
君の在り処は僕じゃない　だろ
ここで生きろ 向かい風でも
僕の在り処を探してた
闇の間に間に間に間に堕ちてくようで
We shouldn't say good-bye
僕の答えを探すため
1人夜の帳　また会える日まで
If we must go with my wishes left here
We dare to cut my neck
If we must go with my wishes left here
We dare to cut my heart
