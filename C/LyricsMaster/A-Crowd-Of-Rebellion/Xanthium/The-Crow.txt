I pray for the eternity I want everything back
Firm ground, clear sky, nothing else All I want is to see them again
You pay it for a sacrifice
"I just want you to stay as you are." You say
With all myself like today can I stay on this place
Like the bathtub?
Don' t wanna get hurt or hurt others
How far can I fly with this wing like down?
We have the enemies, and also you have enemies
Bathtub is now muddy but all I can do is to cling to it
Not to be worn out, link and speak those beautiful words
今日だって　今日だって　誰かの朝一つ糧にして
僕だって　僕だって　全部分かってるよ
People laughed at that which crows made not knowing what it is
Screwed up all the feeling in their mind
Their precious nest are broken up
You're now strong just'cause I'm weak
Get the fuck out of here Crows thought just as the same
今日だって　今日だって　刻まれた笑顔ぼかせぬまま
今日だって　困難で　明け渡した劣情も
分からなくても覚えていてね　羽毟って飛んだ意味を
守りたいのは自分だけだったろう？
I don't know how to stop this war
I know, I know that I can never stop it
もうここにはいられないよ Can't take anymore
君のその手も僕の声も It's enough Who's right who's wrong?
You and me. both evil but that's all
今日だって　今日だって　刻まれた笑顔ぼかせぬまま
今日だって　困難で　明け渡した劣情も
分からなくても覚えていてね　羽毟って飛んだ意味を
あぁ届かないと知る昨日は　触れるための今日へ
For the time to link our souls
We have the enemies, and also you have enemies
I pray and pray Give it back One more time...
You must pay You carry a cross on your back
