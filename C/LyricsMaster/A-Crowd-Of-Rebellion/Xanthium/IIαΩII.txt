非日常に隠れ潜む覚醒
枕元に隠れ忍ぶ隠獣
非日常に隠れ潜む解滅
枕元に隠れ潜む罪豚...嫌ー...罪豚
阿法　墓系　蚊数
因果応報
Step back if you don't care who it is
You are such a party people
Won't you start again from a baby?
Will you please? Because I mean it
My eyes get shit, bitch
Won't you start again from a baby?
Get out from my sight
Look over again, what you believe so
価値観なんて空虚　答えはない I'm saying
God you're believing, it's all the lies
お前何がわかるの
阿法　墓系　蚊数
Don't feel, don't think
さらば　醜人に貸す手はない
さらば　羞人に貸す耳ない
I don't care what you do
It's your choice
So everything is okay?
あぁ、さらば終人に貸す手はない
Look over again, what you believe so
価値観なんて空虚　答えはない I'm saying
God you're believing, it's all the lies
お前何がわかるの
If it rains I find my heart clear
Clear blue sky, it's still in my eyes
君の宗教全部嘘。だから君の宗教全部本当(ウソ)
