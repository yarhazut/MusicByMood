Do you think that your wings can hold us both,
As were dancing to close to the sun (as were dancing)
Theses words were my sanity,
And I've been holding on for far to long,
(Holding on for far to long)
The day will come,
And night will fall,
It's like an endles fight,
I'm just so sick of it all,
As sunrise comes and embraces my weakness,
I must overcome it,
I have to defeat this,
Do you think that your wings can hold us both,
As were dancing to close to the sun (as were dancing)
Theses words were my sanity,
And I've been holding on for far to long,
This wasn't what I had in mind for us,
Oceans apart,
A shudder with disgust,
I wonder will I ever see you again,
(All hope is lost)
Do you think that your wings can hold us both,
As were dancing to close to the sun (as were dancing)
Theses words were my sanity,
And I've been holding on for far to long,
These words were my sanity,
There all I have left,
There all I have left,
I've never been sorry up until now,
And I can't explain this feeling and how,
I've never been sorry up until now,
And I can't explain this feeling and how,
I've never been sorry (never been sorry)
And I can't explain this now,
I've never been sorry (never been sorry)
And I can't explain this now,
I came here a soldier,
With all but a purpose,
Fully equipped (fully equipped)
Wrecked and worthless
