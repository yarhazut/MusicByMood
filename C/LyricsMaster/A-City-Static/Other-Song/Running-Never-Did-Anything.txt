Taking back an oppurtunity,
That I've lost so many times before,
My heart has never beat so strong,
And I meant what I said,
(All along)
If I could only fly,
Tell me what did I do,
'Cause I can't understand,
Anything coming from you,
(Anything coming from you)
And if I had the option,
I would keep you safe from me,
I'm only asking you,
This while I'm still breathing,
If your still breathing,
I've never lied to you it's been,
When I said I had your heart in my hand,
Its stronger than its ever been,
This will be the night,
Underneath the moonlight,
Before I say goodbye,
I'm just wishing,
I had more time,
If I could only fly,
Tell me what did I do,
'Cause I can't understand,
Anything coming from you,
(Anything coming from you)
And if I had the option,
I would keep you safe from me,
If thisever was up to me,
Id rather watch myself leave,
You mean everything to me,
Running never did anything
