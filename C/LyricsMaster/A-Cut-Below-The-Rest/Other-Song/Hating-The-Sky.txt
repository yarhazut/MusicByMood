Were side by side
But doesn't it feel as though were so far away
From here I can feel your skin
But it seems as if I can't even see you
You glow like a firefly in the night
But I'm blinded by the bitter sky tonight
To me you are the one that holds the heavens above
Two stars brighter than the rest
Must be your eyes
So bright they reflect a million times
If only I could fly
Fly so high I could reach the sky
Can the sky fall in pain?
If I used such an awkward tool
Would the sky bleed an early sunset?
A sunset of one color deep and rich
It would seep all through the sky
All over the stars twinkling as your eyes
Would the sky fight back?
Would the stars burn me through the skin?
Look at the water tonight
Lined with trees
Brightly enhanced by Saturns rings
Do you know where we are?
A place where the sky and ground meet
And everything is so nice
But the sky has to crush the ground
Leaving hatred around
Lurking through every cell
If only I could fly
Fly so high I could reach the sky
Can the sky fall in pain?
If I used such an awkward tool
Would the sky bleed an early sunset?
A sunset of one color deep and rich
It would seep all through the sky
All over the stars twinkling as your eyes
Would the sky fight back?
Would the stars burn me through the skin?
Would the stars burn me through the skin?
Would the stars burn me through the skin?
Yes.
