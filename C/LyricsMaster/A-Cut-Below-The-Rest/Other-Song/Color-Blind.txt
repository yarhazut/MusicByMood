Look at the sky tonight
A nice dark green
Streaks of red and blue
Act as magnets lining every cloud
Wait
Where are we?
She says to me
You don't remember?
You fell from the earth
And through the universe
I saved you in the nick of time
Your hourglass was on its last grain
Your mind numbed by the pain
I asked who are you?
What's your name?
She says I'm your savior
You can call me Mary
We traveled through space
Along the path of an untouched place
Through the stars
Around the moon
Faster and faster we flew
The speedometer grew
My insides screamed
Everything was pouring out of me
I felt the pressure in my head
Until I saw nothing but red
Look at the water tonight
A silky orange and purple
The mud around us blue as your eyes
Wait
Where are we?
She says to me
You don't remember?
You fell outside of Saturn
You were caught inside the rings
I saved you in the nick of time
Your hourglass was on its last grain
Your mind numbed by the pain
I asked who are you?
What's your name?
She said I'm your savior
You can call me Jane
