I welcome shades of grey openly 
Anachronistic life unending 
Unnecessary strain compounding 
The failing cognition resounding 
I hate what I become 
When all I am is this 
And the weight collapses me 
As the numbness hits 
I fail again to break the fall 
I'm here all alone wondering how it all will end 
Fighting in vain as into the darkness I descend 
Waiting for light that I know I'll never see 
Desperate for silence once again 
Asphyxiating will incarnate 
The hope of amnesty discarded 
I hate what I have done to build the emptiness 
Into walls I can't unmake and the prison fits 
I fail again to break the fall 
(2x) 
I'm here all alone wondering how it all will end 
Fighting in vain as into the darkness I descend 
Waiting for light that I know I'll never see 
Desperate for silence once again 
Desperate for silence (I am) (2x) 
Desperate for silence once again
