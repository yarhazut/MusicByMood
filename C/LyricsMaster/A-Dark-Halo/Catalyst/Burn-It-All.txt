Open the door and the light washes in. Say what you will, I won't believe it anymore.
Everything's gone, I'm not where I belong,
It's the end of the song ... because I'm free now.
I broke the chain from my neck,
Torn away from that which binds.
Never will I be the one to believe in nothing... Because I'm free.
Unexcused, unabsolved, I am alone but unafraid.
Undermined, undercut, You can't undo what I have made
Unexplained, unresolved, Is it worth the price I have paid.
Understand... I'll burn it all.
Risen from ashes my life can begin. Try what you will you can't resist it anymore.
Everything's wrong, misconception is gone, I am where I belong... and I am free now.
I bear the wounds on my back... scars untold within my mind. Ever will I be the one who will stop at nothing... to remain free.
Unexcused, unabsolved, I am alone but unafraid. Undermined, undercut, You can't undo what I have made Unexplained, unresolved, Is it worth the price I have paid. Understand... I'll burn it all.
