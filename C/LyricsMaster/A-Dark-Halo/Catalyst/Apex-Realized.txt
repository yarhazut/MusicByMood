At the edge strike the heart 
To the core (I feel it). 
Merciless I let slip 
Dogs of war (and I feel it) 
Slowly drown in this cell 
I have wrought (I feel it). 
Someone else 
Forgive me 
I cannot. 
Stone by stone I build day by day, 
Until such time as I must pay. 
One by one the thoughts fade away to nothing. 
I am left with this; 
The apex realized. 
Slowly drown in this cell 
I have wrought (I feel it). 
Someone else forgive me 
I cannot. 
(4x) 
Stone by stone I build day by day, 
Until such time as I must pay. 
One by one the thoughts fade away to nothing. 
I'm left with this; 
The apex realized.
