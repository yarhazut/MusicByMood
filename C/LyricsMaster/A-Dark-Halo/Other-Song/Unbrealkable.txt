Complete what I may 
On this last of all days 
Unmake errors committed to stone 
Headfirst into the nightmare unknown 
Reckoning here at last 
From the feast to the fast 
Wretched soul come and passed 
I am again unbreakable 
Rebuild what was lost 
Blood spent meaningless as a cost 
Construct of control wrought by my hand 
Battered and broken alone I stand 
Reckoning here at last 
From the feast to the fast 
Wretched soul come and passed 
I am again unbreakable 
I am again unbreakable (2x)
