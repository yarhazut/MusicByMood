Confused, condemned, detained.
Interred, entombed, restrained.
Contract, collapse, divide.
Expand, explode, collide.
I brought this
All on myself.
It brings me.
Back down to this place
Again for the last time.
I can't survive this again.
Contract, collapse, divide.
Expand, explode, collide.
I brought this
All on myself.
It brings me.
(3x)
Back down to this place
Again for the last time.
I can't survive this again.
