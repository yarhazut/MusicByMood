When I wake up I still feel the same,
I don't know why I thought things would change,
I'd never thought I'd push love away,
But I feel some hurt I just can't face the pain makes us the same
We are walking through the valley night until we find the sun
If everything is alright then why do we decide to run
If I feel love then I feel pain
Is this enough this enough
A life of pride, a life of shame
Is this enough is this enough
Why we staring down this silent road
I imagine places and people we used to know
But there are time when life seems so clear
And now I think of places that aren't here
That I wish I was near
We are walking through the valley night until we find the sun
If everything is alright then why do we decide to run
If I feel love then I feel pain
Is this enough this enough
A life of pride a life of shame
Is this enough this enough
If I feel Love then I feel pain
Is this enough this enough
A life of pride a life of shame
Is this enough this enough
Yea if love can bring you peace
Then love can love and
If love can bring you peace then love can love
If I feel Love then I feel pain
Is this enough this enough
A life of pride a life of shame
Is this enough this enough
If I feel Love then I feel pain
Is this enough this enough
A life of pride a life of shame
Is this enough this enough
