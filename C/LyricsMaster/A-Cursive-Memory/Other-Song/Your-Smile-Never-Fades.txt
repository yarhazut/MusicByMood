Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Wipe down the combination to your heart
Lost spinning round and round to watch it come apart
I know the things you say and what you do
Are all spinning one four three times to open the heart from you
I know you want to go to bed when I wake up
I know you want the window open when I want it shut
I know you want to leave when I would love to stay
I know you want to be different from me in every way
The things that I can't stand
The things you always do
The thing that hurts the most
Is that I can't have you
The finger tips, the long blonde hair, the tight blue jeans you always wear
I miss it so, I miss it so
I miss you, yes I do
If it heals, you're so far away
But even in the distance, your smile never fades
If it heals, you're so far away
But even in the distance, your smile never fades
The things that I can't stand
The things you always do
The thing that hurts the most
Is that I can't have you
The finger tips, the long blonde hair, the tight blue jeans you always wear
I miss it so, I miss it so
I miss you, yes I do
Well we would laugh
And we would smile
We would dance and we would try to
I was real, and you were fake
Just remember with me for goodness sake
I was always honest, and I was always faithful
But I guess it wasn't enough for you
