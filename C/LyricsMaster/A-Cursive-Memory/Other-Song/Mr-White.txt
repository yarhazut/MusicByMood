Get out the candlelight
I'll strike the match to watch them ignite
Why are people so frantic when we can get so romantic
Why are people so fake when we can boogie and we can shake
You see we're worn down
We're more down than everyone else in town
You're more down than everyone else in town
I'm more down than everyone else in town
Yesterday is history
Tomorrow is a mystery
Well today is a gift and it makes it the present
Yesterday is history
Tomorrow is a mystery
Well today is a gift and it makes it the present
Well it's time to tone it down
It's time to dim the lights
Get up, get out your parents favorite red wine and crank the Barry White
We'll call it magic
No, no let's call it classic
When we get together and make history
(It's a mystery)
It's a mystery
It's a mystery
Yesterday is history
Tomorrow is a mystery
Well today is a gift and it makes it the present
Yesterday is history
Tomorrow is a mystery
Well today is a gift and it makes it the present
It's a mystery
Yesterday is history
Tomorrow is a mystery
Well today is a gift and it makes it the present
Yesterday is history
Tomorrow is a mystery
Well today is a gift and it makes it the present
