This is where the best act is in town
Like ashes ashes they will all fall down
They will all come and watch the play today
You pray for this day
We'll start to on my count,
We'll start that count right about now
Lights camera action (3, 2, 1)
All right lets make something clear
I'm the star and the only star that's here
The only one that will give it his all
The only one that takes the fall
Its time to further adieu
Thousands sitting number 99 is you
Now that we are ready on my go
Ladies and gentlemen enjoy the show
And we all have a dream
And in every act and every scene
There's got to be a star and I'm the only star so far (X2)
Ring around the rosies with pockets full of posies,
Step backwards, backwards, backwards, and we'll stay off
The ground (x2)
Its time to further adieu
Thousands sitting number 99 is you
Now that we are ready on my go
Ladies and gentlemen enjoy the show
And we all have a dream
And in every act and every scene
There's got to be a star and I'm the only star so far (X2)
Ring around the rosies with pockets full of posies,
Step backwards, backwards, backwards, and we'll stay off
The ground (X2)
Its time to further adieu
Thousands sitting number 99 is you
Now that we are ready on my go
Ladies and gentlemen enjoy the show
Ring around the rosies with pockets full of posies,
Step backwards, backwards, backwards, and we'll stay off
The ground (X2)
