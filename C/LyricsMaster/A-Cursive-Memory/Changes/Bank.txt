The way it started, I had no doubt,
Your lips were soft and I was down,
Our fingers laced and our hands tied,
Our lips were locked and it felt right.
But suddenly you became the largest crook known to fame,
The biggest cheat, most wanted thief around.
Get out of the bank now,
Run for the gates now,
Even if we fall there won't be a lead at all,
(Don't you see).
Yeah, it started with good clean fun,
But just like that our start was done,
From hello you set me up,
And chose me as the victim of...
So lock the doors and hit the lights,
She's breaking in tonight,
She won't give up without a fight,
She wont.
Get out of the bank now,
Run for the gates now,
Even if we fall there won't be a lead at all,
(Don't you see)
