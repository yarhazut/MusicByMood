Let's get this on tonight
We'll turn down all the lights
We knew it felt so right
I saw you,
From across the room,
I saw you,
And I said to myself
By the end of the night
We make some time
To have a conversation that will start this off right
Cause you looked
Right into my eyes
You looked,
So shocked and surprised
'Cause I've been catching looks from across the room
Watching you fake conversation
Because you knew that I was looking too
Let's get this on tonight
We'll turn down all the lights
We knew it felt so right
Even if this is just for tonight
From then on,
It was all over,
Ya from then on,
We kept getting closer
Well you came down the stairs, grabbed my hand and lead me
Through a long lit hallway, to the bedroom and you said to me
Let's get this on tonight
We'll turn down all the lights
We knew it felt so right
Even if this is just for tonight
