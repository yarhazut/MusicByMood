The pain that you have fought, the pain that you have broken,
I bet you never thought these words, they would be spoken now.
There is nothing we can say, there is nothing we can do.
There is no way to change the things you can't undo now.
Go ahead and go now,
Go ahead and go now,
Go ahead and go now,
I'm sure that I could figure out,
Go show all the angels how,
Go show all the angels how,
Go show all the angels how,
Show them what you've found out.
As life comes and goes, it seems too quick,
But man, it was suppose to end up like this.
It doesn't stop here, your journey goes farther,
You're right on time for your 3 AM departure.
Go ahead and leave, you've got to believe,
Don't be afraid, it's okay.
Go ahead and go now,
Go ahead and go now,
Go ahead and go now,
I'm sure that I could figure out,
Go show all the angels how,
Go show all the angels how,
Go show all the angels how,
Show them what you've found out.
Sir, you've fought an honest battle, but this was meant to be,
Soldiers tip your hats to the colonel, this was his legacy.
The rain outside won't stop and it's your time to go, 
The clouds are moving in but that grey is looking cold.
A new day, a new life, a new world, a new time,
So this time, let's live right, 'cause some day,
We'll all die.
He's breaking out, he's laying down,
He left a heart to talk about.
He's breaking out, he's laying down,
He left a heart to talk about.
He opened his soul and his mind, 
It's what he needed this time.
He opened his soul and his mind, 
It's what he needed this time.
Go ahead and go now,
Go ahead and go now,
Go ahead and go now,
I'm sure that I could figure out,
Go show all the angels how,
Go show all the angels how,
Go show all the angels how,
Show them what you've found out.
