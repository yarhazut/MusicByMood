The wind felt like a frail storm
With the chimes still singing the summer's born
Say goodbye to the rest of the rain
We ran until there was no daylight
When the sun went down and day turned to night
The cities lights with such sustain
And there I stood
As if I could
Be the one to make things right
Oh, you got me running backwards and running forwards and
Oh, you got me lost inside your eyes with no way out
Where I get lost?
I got caught inside your arms
And even when things get rough
Baby you give me a different kind of love
The sea was calling when we started to walk
The moon came out and we began to talk
True stars come out at night
Me and you we were like stars
Like a movie with a screen do you know who we are?
Thank the moon for our spotlight
And there I stood
As if I could
Be the one to make things right
Oh, you got me running backwards and running forwards and
Oh, you got me lost inside your eyes with no way out
Where I get lost?
I got caught inside your arms
And even when things get rough
Baby you give me a different kind of love
Got me running backwards and running forwards
Got me lost inside your eyes
And there she was, just because she was made for the spotlight
Ah, you got me running backwards and running forwards and
Oh, you got me lost inside your eyes with no way out
Where I get lost?
I got caught inside your arms
And even when things get rough
Baby you give me a different kind of love
Oh, you got me running backwards and running forwards and
Oh, you got me lost inside your eyes with no way out
Where I get lost?
I got caught inside your arms
And even when things get rough
Baby you give me a different kind of love
