I've been getting so caught up in the way it I was brought up
The things I do the things I had said
I've been trying and trying just to watch all these lions raging in and outside of me
Someday you'll say
I will be gone I will be gone
Someday you'll say
It won't be long
I would rather be nothing than be looked at as something
Through the eyes of these social royals
And if I had just one word to describe what my friends were
The last thing I would say would be loyal
Someday you'll say
I will be gone I will be gone
Someday you'll say
It won't be long
I just want to move on
I just want to belong
I just want to get along
My past is after me
And I'm trying to break free from all these mess ups and bad memories
I just want to move on to a new place I belong to
New places and new faces to me
Someday you'll say
I will be gone I will be gone
Someday you'll say
It won't be long
I just want to move on
I just want to belong
I just want to get along
I just want to move on
I just want to belong
I just want to get along
Someday you'll say
I will be gone I will be gone
Someday you'll say
It won't be long
I just want to move on
I just want to belong
I just want to get along
