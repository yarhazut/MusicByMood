Close your eyes and watch it all pass us as we know,
Because everything in this world is here today and gone tomorrow.
So get up and get down and everybody crowd around,
Because this is the sound,
Get up and get down and everybody crowd around,
Because we're getting down.
Stop and try to figure out why change never stops,
You'll realise that all the change,
It won't ever drop.
So listen up and listen now and everybody crowd around,
Because this is the sound,
Get up and get down and everybody crowd around,
Because we're getting down.
Changes, changes, we're always changing, life goes in stages,
Changes, changes, nobody knows, life comes and goes.
We're moving on and on.
Changes, changes, we're always changing, life goes in stages,
Changes, changes, nobody knows, life comes and goes
