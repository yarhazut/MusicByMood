Welcome to my dreamiest nightmare,
Where you're so close but you never get there
There's still some things you need to say to me
Because my love, you're my farthest destiny
I never thought I'd say this again
The three words that you never said
The one phrase that breaks a heart in two
'Cause angel, I love you
If I could turn the clock again
It's the same three words I wish I never said
The phrase that breaks a heart in two
'Cause angel, I love you
Angel, you're the closest thing
That I've wanted most but you still can't see
I say five vowels and three syllables
They're unnoticed, and you're so dreamable
I never thought I'd say this again
The three words that you never said
The one phrase that breaks a heart in two
'Cause angel, I love you
If I could turn the clock again
It's the same three words I wish I never said
The phrase that breaks a heart in two
'Cause angel, I love you
If I could turn the clock again
It's the same three words I wish I never said
The phrase that breaks a heart in two
'Cause angel, I love you
If I could turn the clock again
(I never thought I'd say this again)
It's the same three words I wish I never said
(The three words that you never said)
The one phrase that breaks a heart in two
Because angel, I love you.
Angel you were the closest thing 
That I've wanted
