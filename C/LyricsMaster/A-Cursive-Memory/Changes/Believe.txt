Something's got to give,
Something's got to give.
Let's talk about life,
Let's talk about it twice.
Everybody wants something magical.
Everybody wants something beautiful.
Everybody wants something to see,
Something to see...
Something's got to give,
Something's got to give.
Let's talk about believing,
Let's talk about leaving.
Everybody wants something magical.
Everybody wants something beautiful.
Everybody wants something to see,
Something to see...
Just believe.
Do you believe in anything?
God or luck or hope or fate,
Do you believe in anything?
