This time I realize
You're looking this way
With your real eyes
You're the beat that can't stop
The peak of my plot
That deep in my thought
The time on my watch
You're the air that I breathe
The world that I see
You are, you are
I can never find a way
Or the right things to say
I guess I just didn't know how
You see, the longer that we wait
The more time things can take
I guess we'll have to spell it out
You're my E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G
Everywhere, every time, everything
You're my E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G
Everywhere, every time, everything
You're the beat that can't stop
The peak of my plot
That deep in my thought
The time on my watch
You're the air that I breathe
The world that I see
You are, you are
I can never find a way
Or the right things to say
I guess I just didn't know how
You see, the longer that we wait
The more time things can take
I guess we'll have to spell it out
You're my E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G
Everywhere, every time, everything
You're my E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G
Everywhere, every time, everything
Girl, I can't stop thinking about anyone else but you
Girl, I can't stop thinking about anyone else but you
Girl, I can't stop thinking about anyone else but you
So go hard
So go hard
You're my E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G
Everywhere, every time, everything
You're my E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G
Everywhere, every time, everything
Girl, I can't stop thinking about anyone else but you
