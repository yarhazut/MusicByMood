You're my Sun, my Moon, my Skies,
You're my everything...
You're my Sun, my Moon, my Skies,
You're my everything
And everyday being with you, makes me
Think, what a new day will bring
You're my life and my breath
You're exactly what I need right now
And I'll never take you for granted
No, not for a moment
And then I find myself alone out here
Thinking of what we could have been
And I know this loneliness is not for me
And then I find myself alone out here
Thinking of what we could have been
And I know this loneliness is not for me
We should be together for eternity
Don't let go to let me know this is over
And maybe I held on too long but now, I see
The life I left was not the best, and now I no longer believe
You're not the one I knew but I'll stay true to my heart and myself
And then I find myself alone out here
Thinking of what we could have been
And I know this loneliness is not for me
And then I find myself alone out here
Thinking of what we could have been
And I know this loneliness is not for me
We should be together for eternity
I know I'll find myself
I know I'll find myself
I know I'll find myself
I know I'll find myself
