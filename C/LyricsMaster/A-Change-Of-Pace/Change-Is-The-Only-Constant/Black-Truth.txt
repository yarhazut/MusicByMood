NO safe from the silence still haunting me
Away from this place where I've been too long
A mejestic sunset lays in wait for that beautiful day
That was never meant to be
When time and space collide in this head-on crash
Who will be the first to break these silences with lies
If truth is pain then let me be your masochist
And bury the rest in this burning flame that is my life
This fate has dealt me nothing but broken glass
A single note that always rings off-key
Just like the lines used in an overplayed tragedy
This time we've gone too far
You were so much better than this
This time we've gone too far
Leave all your lies
Leave all your tears
Remember Change is the only constant...
Black Truth, White Lies
Black Truth, White Lies
Black Truth, White Lies
Black Truth, White Lies
Black Truth, White Lies
Black Truth, White Lies
Black Truth, White Lies
Black Truth, White Lies
You were so much better than this...
You were so much better than this...
You were so much better than this...
You were so much better than this...
You were so much better than this...
You were so much better than this...
