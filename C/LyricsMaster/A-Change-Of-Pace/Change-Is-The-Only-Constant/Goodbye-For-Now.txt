And when the smoke clears nothing's left
Black ashes still fall from the sky
I see a figure standing far away
And a shadow on the ground, but I don't know why (I don't know why)
I've lost all hope in you
I want out of this place called home tonight
So goodbye for now
I'm never coming back 
No, not tonight
And life is so dark with your eyes always closed
You'll never see a thing
I never wanted any of this 
No not at all
But it will be okay (okay)
I've lost all hope in you
I want out of this place called home tonight
So goodbye for now
I'm never coming back
No, not tonight
Bittersweet every touch 
Still burning in my memory
Can't turn back the hand of time
Can't make believe that you're still mine
'Cause you're so far away
Goodbye for now...
I've lost all hope in you
I want out of this place called home tonight
So goodbye for now
I'm never coming back 
No, not tonight
All eyes off me
No more pathetic memories
