Tears from yesterday carry on through tomorrow
These words were too soft-spoken and I don't want to regret anything
No letter could express this fear I feel inside
But I'll write it anyway
Your name will be the last from my lips (my lips)
Your face the last image in my eyes (my eyes)
Don't let the wind blow and take this all away
Only in death will we rise
I'll leave you these final words and pray for better days
My voice a vague memory washed away by your tears
It's hard to contemplate the obvious
But you're strong eough to make it through (To make it through)
"A poetic tragedy falls upon your doorstep as you wake
Confide in your friends and family to wash this pain away
Goodbyes are inevitable 
But I will see you again 
And never forget the simple fact that I will always love you
Did I do you proud?"
Your name will be the last from my lips (my lips)
Your face the last image in my eyes (my eyes)
Don't let the wind blow and take this all away
Only in death will we rise
Will we rise...
Will we rise...
Will we rise...
Will we rise...
