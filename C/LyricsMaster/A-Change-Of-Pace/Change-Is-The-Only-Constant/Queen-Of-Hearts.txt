My perfect angel, staring at the stars above
I put my hand to your cheek
For one last kiss goodnight, one more small goodbye
So that I don't lose my mind
I can't put this into words through voice or hand
Your love is the best thing that I'll never have
The time and pain put in this will not be in vain
The love I have to share will always stay
I'll take the blame for this, that's why I write this song
I should have seen it coming all along
I'll take the blame for this, that's why I write this song
I should have seen it coming all along
My Perfect Angel, staring at my blood-soaked hands
I put my hand to your cheek
For one last touch of life, one more silent prayer
So that I can say goodbye
I can't put this into words through voice or hand
Your love is the best thing that I'll never have
The time and pain put in this will not be in vain
The love I have to share will always stay
I'll take the blame for this, that's why I write this song
I should have seen it coming all along
I'll take the blame for this, that's why I write this song
I should have seen it coming all along
I'll take the blame for this, that's why I write this song
I should have seen it coming all along (all along)
I'll take the blame for this, that's why I write this song
I should have seen it coming all along
I'll take the blame for this, that's why I write this song
I should have seen it coming all along (all along)
I'll take the blame for this, that's why I write this song
I should have seen it coming all along
We'll always be the same
We'll never change, never change
We'll always be the same 
We'll never change
We'll always be the same 
We'll never change, never change 
We'll always be the same
We'll never change!
