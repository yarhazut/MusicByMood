There are no "Goodbye"s only "See you again"s
And Minnesota is too far away to picture your eyes
So here's to a love that will be a dying flame
I'll wait for you to come back home
Don't say goodbye just leave your tears on my shoulder
And recognize this passing time as our story unfolds
So this time it's my turn to wait for you,
And I'll be the one you're holding on to
My picture on your wall hangs higher than the rest
This image in my mind plays more than the last time you saw me
And I will see you again
I made a CD with all those songs that make me think about you
And now that you're gone I find myself counting the days till you're home
So here's a song from me to you with all those things that were left unsaid
And memories fade away but we'll be the same
Don't say goodbye just leave your tears on my shoulder
And recognize this passing time as our story unfolds
Good, Goodbye, to this bittersweet romance
Good, Goodbye, to this bittersweet romance
Good, Goodbye, to this bittersweet romance
('Cause fate has a funny way of dealing me these cards)
Good, Goodbye, to this bittersweet romance
('Cause fate has a funny way of dealing me these cards)
So this time it's my turn to wait for you,
And I'll be the one you're holding on to
My picture on your wall hangs higher than the rest
This image in my mind plays more than the last time you saw me
And I will see you again
(Good, Goodbye, to this bittersweet romance
Good, Goodbye, to this bittersweet romance)
So this time it's my turn to wait for you
And no holiday will be the same without your
Voice whispering those words of comfort
Come back soon don't keep me waiting here forever
