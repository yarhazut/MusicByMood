Hey buddy are you still that dick I knew from school?
Or have you found out yet you were never that cool?
You know you made my high school days a living hell
But it's coming back to you and you can't even tell
Cars drop money, you've got 'em yeah it's true
But I've got more than you
You had your fun but I just stole your girlfriend
Now you're, now you're finally gonna see
You had your run but seems I stole your girlfriend
Now you're, now you're wishing you were me
You're looking pissed off don't tell me you're surprised
Cause here's the kicker, I'm not the only guy
So go on happily with your Mercedes life
But just remember I've got the better ride
She's built for comfort and knows her way around
We'll be tearing up the town
You had your fun but I just stole your girlfriend
Now you're, now you're finally gonna see
You had your run but seems I stole your girlfriend
Now you're, now you're wishing you were me
Don't feel so bad about it
I know you'll feel sad about it
You know you'll survive without it
But I'll have all the fun
Oh, yeah yeah yeah, whoa oh oh
You had your fun but I just stole your girlfriend
Now you're, now you're finally gonna see
You had your run but seems I stole your girlfriend
Now you're, now you're wishing you were me
You had your fun but I just stole your girlfriend
Now you're, now you're finally gonna see
You had your run but seems I stole your girlfriend
Now you're, now you're wishing you were me
Now you're, now you're wishing you were me
Now you're, now you're wishing you were me
