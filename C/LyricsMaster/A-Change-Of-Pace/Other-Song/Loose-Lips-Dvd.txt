So I made you lie!
And we both hope
This will pass by
Through our lifelines
Standing broken
Come on tell me
You can't hurt me
Don't ignore the
Lies your bleeding
Entranced in noise
And words and phrases
All about you
Everyone was so right
I know something you don't know
You hid something obvious from me
I know something you'll never know
You hid something obvious from me
Envy sets in
And I hate you
For what you did
I will break you
Cry for help now
They can't hear you
Here's an offer
You can't refuse
Scream a little bit louder for me baby
Face the truth
That you painted so well
I know something you don't know
You hid something obvious from me
I know something you'll never know
You hid something obvious from me
Scream my name
At the top of your lungs
Help me to know
Why I should care
Destroy our past
I'll still have
These memories
You'll never take from me
I know something you don't know
You hid something obvious from me
I know something you'll never know
You hid something obvious from me
Scream my name!
