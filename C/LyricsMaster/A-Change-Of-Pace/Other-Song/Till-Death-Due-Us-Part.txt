You can't live to make mistakes
When you're dead and gone
With your heart held in my head
The memory of your bloodstains
All over broken picture frames
How could you tell me that I was wrong? (I was wrong)
When you would have done the same
Toy with emotions until they're gone (You were wrong)
You would have done the same
I stole your heart
Ripped it out
And smashed it on this floor
You have no need for such a useless thing
Broken, forever more.
Life after this
There's no such thing
You replace my thoughts
With these painful memories
Now you're gone
You're 9 feet under
To far down to ever uncover
How could you tell me that I was wrong? (I was wrong)
When you would have done the same
Toy with emotions until they're gone (you were wrong)
You would have done the same
I stole your heart
Ripped it out
And smashed it on this floor
You have no need for such a useless thing
Broken, forever more.
Leave it all to me
I won't forget about you
Leave it all to me
I'll steal your heart!
Leave it all to me
I won't forget about you
Leave it all to me
I'll steal your heart!
I stole your heart
Ripped it out
And smashed it on this floor
You have no need for such a useless thing
Broken, forever more.
(I stole your heart
Ripped it out
And smashed it on this floor
You have no need for such a useless thing
Broken, forever more.)
Now you're gone
You're 9 feet under
To far down to ever uncover
Now you're gone
You're 9 feet under
To far down to ever uncover
