I'm alive when I'm missing you
I'm heading out for the lone star state and flying over Santa Fe
I'm looking out at a mountain range
I brace myself for the life I made
We're too young at heart, hoping for one more day
This airport terminal can't see
Everything you mean to me
I'm alive when I'm missing you
I'm alive but to far
I'm alive when I'm missing you
I'm alive but to far from your room
I remember not sleeping
Hold on tight, come with me
I left my heart on your bed sheets
Not knowing what it means to be here on a plane leaving you
This airport terminal can't see
Everywhere I wish you'd be
I'm alive when I'm missing you
I'm alive but to far
I'm alive when I'm missing you
I'm alive but to far from your room
Girl you can't make me stay
I'm saying what I have to say
Know you were just a phase
A piece of who I am today
Just another checkmark on my list of things that I regret
You're another checkmark on my list of things that I regret
I'm alive when I'm missing you
I'm alive but not missing you
I'm alive and I sleep fine
I'm alive but not missing you
I'm alive and I sleep fine in my own room
