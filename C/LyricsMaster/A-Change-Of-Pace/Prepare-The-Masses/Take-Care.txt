I'm chasing time
Looking for a beat
Open your eyes and repeat after me
You try so hard to find a rhythm in your heartbeat
The less you know the more you want
To try to justify the secrets of your lifetime
The meaning to come for us
So take care of you and I'll take care of me
We're just lonely hearts looking for better days
Take care of you and I'll take care of me
We're just lonely hearts looking for better days
Break to break it down
Will I find clarity?
On a hotel board
When I fall asleep?
You try so hard to find a rhythm in your heartbeat
The less you know the more you want
To try to justify the secrets of your lifetime
The meaning to come for us
I'm looking for a safe way out
'Cause I'm in the habit of breaking young girls' hearts
I've been looking for a safe way out
'Cause I'm in the habit of breaking young girls' hearts
You try so hard to find a rhythm in your heartbeat
The less you know the more you want
To try to justify the secrets of your lifetime
The meanings will come for us
So take care of you and I'll take care of me
We're just lonely hearts looking for better days
Take care of you and I'll take care of me
We're just lonely hearts looking for better days
I've been looking for a safe way out
('Cause I'm in the habit of breaking young girls' hearts)
Open your eyes...
