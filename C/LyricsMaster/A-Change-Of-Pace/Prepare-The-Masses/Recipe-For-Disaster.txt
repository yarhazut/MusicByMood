To all those listening, this is my story
About a confused girl and a boy that's boring
So either look at me, stupid and awkward
But you leave and tell me it seems much better
So she'll run away from the problems
She knows distance can't make hearts follow
Five more days and counting before you start packing
Can't give me three good reasons why we can't get back to square one
"It's ok," you'll tell me to my face, stop lying
Every three or four tries
And now five days are gone
I've got a recipe, it's for disaster
Because that's all I see in my near future
She's got the blond hair, but not the blue eyes
I've got the right girl, but at the wrong time
I've seen better days, maybe even weeks
When I think of you, you're thinking of me
Five more days and counting before you start packing
Can't give me three good reasons why we can't get back to square one
"It's ok," you'll tell me to my face, stop lying
Every three or four tries
And now five days are gone
And you said you'd always come back
So where are you now?
I'm not ready for the letdown
Will you be right back?
And you said you'd always come back
So where are you now?
I'm not ready for the letdown
Will you be right back?
I've seen better days, maybe even weeks
When I think of you, you're thinking of me
Five more days and counting before you start packing
Can't give me three good reasons why we can't get back to square one
"It's ok," you'll tell me to my face, stop lying
Every three or four tries
And now five days are gone
