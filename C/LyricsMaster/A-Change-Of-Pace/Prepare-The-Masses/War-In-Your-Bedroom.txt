It's a war in your bedroom baby
I'd cut off my tongue for just a taste
Of a piece of your flesh my darling
We've got no time to hesitate
The bathroom's fogging up with our heartbeats, sweat from me
I watch your nails scraping down the back of my neck
I've got a burning in my chest - its coming from your thighs
This is me and you, you and me for the first time
I've been waiting you've been dreaming of everything I'm talking about
It's a war in your bedroom baby
I'd cut off my tongue for just a taste
Of a piece of your flesh my darling
We've got no time to hesitate
I've got a picture perfect memory under covers
I'll say exactly what you want to hear, I'll make you scream
There's not a drop of your innocence when you shiver
Don't go lover, stay all night, now you're mine
I've been waiting you've been dreaming of everything I'm talking about
It's a war in your bedroom baby
I'd cut off my tongue for just a taste
Of a piece of your flesh my darling
We've got no time to hesitate
Sex is everywhere (sex is everywhere)
It's you and me
It's you to me
It's a war in your bedroom...
It's a war in your bedroom...
It's a war in your bedroom baby
I'd cut off my tongue for just a taste
Of a piece of your flesh my darling
We've got no time to hesitate
