Prepare the masses, cause this means war
And if it's a fight they want, we'll bring the hell they're looking for
With bullets blazing, the cowards hit the floor
Stand up and fight like men, let God decide who's coming
Now sit back and watch the story unfold
Of the fair Juliet and her Romeo
Two young lovers with one heartbeat
In a devoted grave is where they sleep
They are the passion in a city of hate
Watching two families quarrel, ruining lovers fate
You are the ones who took your children's lives
So your children have died in love's true light (Light)
Sing me to sleep tonight, sweet Juliet
Two star-crossed lovers marry, looking for regrets
By daybreak I'll be gone and searching for your kiss
Leave me a drop of poison waiting on your lips
In every war there will be casualties
Even family members and best friends bleed
Another tally on the body count
So how many more until we're all bled out?
Let's not forget about this tale of love
Replay this story as it's told to us
Life is precious but worth giving away
For ideals of beauty and better days (Days)
Sing me to sleep tonight, sweet Juliet
Two star-crossed lovers marry, looking for regrets
By daybreak I'll be gone and searching for your kiss
Leave me a drop of poison waiting on your lips
I'm killing 'cause it's revenge I seek
In fair Verona I will lay him down, down to sleep
In desperation, poison becomes
This story's ending in a tomb of lover's trust (Trust)
Sing me to sleep tonight, sweet Juliet
Two star-crossed lovers marry, looking for regrets
By daybreak I'll be gone and searching for your kiss
Leave me a drop of poison waiting on your lips
