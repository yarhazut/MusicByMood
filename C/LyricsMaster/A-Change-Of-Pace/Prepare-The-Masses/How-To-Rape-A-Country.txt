The beat of war reigns on
Can you hear the sound of marching drums?
And bullets fill the sky
Men kill to show their nation's pride
The smell of death and blood
Lingers off your loved one's clothes
Wind up in bed, my friend
Brothers' in arms until the end 
Summer's sweet with dreams of more
Hand in hand, our march unknown
We've got a thirst for your blood
It's pumping through our veins
Wait till the moment arrives
Show no mercy
We've got a thirst for your blood
It's pumping through our veins
Wait till the moment arrives
Show no mercy
What do we have to fear?
Livestock, let's blow them all away
Then hide yourself in sleep
The war will take you in the night
Eyes bloodshot, red-strained ears
You'll see the ghost inside their eyes
A country left in tears
Watching the black burning sky
Summer's sweet with dreams of more
Hand in hand, our march unknown
We've got a thirst for your blood
It's pumping through our veins
Wait till the moment arrives
Show no mercy
We've got a thirst for your blood
It's pumping through our veins
Wait till the moment arrives
Show no mercy
Dreams of more
We've got a thirst for your blood
(We've got a thirst for your blood)
Wait till the moment arrives
(Show no mercy)
We've got a thirst for your blood
It's pumping through our veins
Wait till the moment arrives
Show no mercy
We've got a thirst for your blood
It's pumping through our veins
Wait till the moment arrives
Show no mercy
We've got a thirst for your blood
It's pumping through our veins
Wait till the moment arrives
Show no mercy
