No trigger
This be true
It's our last wish too
Our minds cause us so much that damage boys
You drink our body too
Give me those bright blue eyes
And those luscious lips
And I'll sing this song for you
If you shake or sit
And I know that
You want it too
'Cause I see it
Like I see through you
I'm walking on a white line
And this is a big surprise
I can't sleep any more
It just these little pills
That make my dreams feel really
Nice, you're craving for
This show comes to an end
And now the fun begins
Just step into your skin
And let things unfold
Your body moves me, girl
And now you're whispering
Everything I want to hear
I'm pulling on window strings
And I know that
You want it too
'Cause I see it
Like I see through you
(See through you)
I'm walking on a white line
And this is a big surprise
I can't sleep any more
It just these little pills
That make my dreams feel really
Nice, you're craving for
I'm walking on a white line
And this is a big surprise
I can't sleep any more
It just these little pills
That make my dreams feel really
Nice, you're craving for
