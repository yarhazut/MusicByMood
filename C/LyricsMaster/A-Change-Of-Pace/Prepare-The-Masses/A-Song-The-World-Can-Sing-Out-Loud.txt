I won't buy a word you sold me
I'm going places you never dreamed about
So tired of stupid stories
I'll write a song the world can sing aloud
We'll break the mold they gave us
We're going places they never dreamed about
Jump in and join the chorus
We're writing songs the world can
Shout out loud
Lend me your voice, sing it
Louder, I can't hear it
Lend me your voice, sing it
Louder, I can't hear it
I'm looking back on all those long days
When I was just a kid without a care
You asked what could I have to say
And I replied, "you're listening to it here"
Flashbacks are force of habit
When we were just some kids without a care
The living room we used to practice
The songs that you're listening
To right here
Lend me your voice, sing it
Louder, I can't hear it
Lend me your voice, sing it
Louder, I can't hear it
My head's a mess it's waiting to unfold
My head's a mess I'm waiting to unfold
Would you listen to me?
Would you listen to me?
My head's a mess it's waiting to unfold
My head's a mess I'm waiting to unfold
Would you listen to me?
Would you listen to me?
Lend me your voice, sing it
Louder, I can't hear it
Lend me your voice, sing it
Louder, I can't hear it
Lend me your voice sing it
