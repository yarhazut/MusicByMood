Picture perfect
Turned to worthless
Bittersweet, the taste is like ash in my mouth
Love we had it
You're a bad habit 
I'm ready to give you up
I give up
Silly me for thinking honesty is something
Given free, I make the rules
And this is how it ends.
Heartbreak baby is half the fun
You bring the bullets, I'll bring the guns
Take ten steps now turn and draw
I shoot from the hip then watch you fall
Heartbreak baby is half the fun
You bring the bullets, I'll bring the guns
Take ten steps now turn and draw
I shoot from the hip then watch you fall
Scenes of passion
Never lasted
Your mistakes are too much to put behind
I am tired
With no desire 
To put together things that just fall apart 
Silly me for thinking honesty is something
Given free, I make the rules
And this is how it ends.
Heartbreak baby is half the fun
You bring the bullets, I'll bring the guns
Take ten steps now turn and draw
I shoot from the hip then watch you fall
Heartbreak baby is half the fun
You bring the bullets, I'll bring the guns
Take ten steps now turn and draw
I shoot from the hip then watch you fall
Then watch you fall
Silly me for thinking honesty is something
Given free, I make the rules
And this is how it ends.
Heartbreak baby is half the fun
You bring the bullets, I'll bring the guns
Take ten steps now turn and draw
I shoot from the hip then watch you fall
Heartbreak baby is half the fun
You bring the bullets, I'll bring the guns
Take ten steps now turn and draw
I shoot from the hip then watch you fall
