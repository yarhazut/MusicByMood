Now everybody put on your dance shoes
Its time we all got footloose
Just follow me
I'm making time to cut up the floor
Its in your eyes and I want so much more, that you're not giving
You're shaking this poor boys world
Just put him out of his misery
Take me for a ride
Through devious eyes
And when I wake up tomorrow
These bed sheets tell lies
No words can disguise
That I don't wanna wake up at all
Wake Up!
We're all sweating to the oldies now
The King's back for a night on the town
One thing on my mind
Oh no I fell into your trance again
Your eyes are digging into my skin and I want more
You're breaking this poor boys mind
Just put him out of his misery
Take me for a ride
Through devious eyes
And when I wake up tomorrow
These bed sheets tell lies
No words can disguise
That I don't wanna wake up at all
I wanna be your rock and roll for old time's sake
I know I said I hate those lies but they're what keeps me coming back
Take me for a ride
Through devious eyes
And when I wake up tomorrow
Take me for a ride
Devious eyes
And when I wake up tomorrow
These bed sheets tell lies
No words can disguise
That I don't wanna wake up at all
Wake Up!
