CD Version:
Weekends are for the warriors
All those late nights
Walking through front doors at daybreak
Raise all
Of your glasses high
This ones for all of us sitting around here
On Friday night
I remember eighteen,
Hating Mondays
And sitting staring at the clock
Dying to get away
Don't look back
And have no regrets
We've only got two days,
And time wont wait for us
I couldn't ask for
A better place to be
This can't last forever
Raise your glass together
Doesn't get much better
No better than...
This can't last forever
Raise your glass together
Doesn't get much better
No better than this
I've been to hell and back
All the snow storms
In the bathroom stalls
Which you pulled me out of
I'll be there
Like you've been there
My words, my bond
Don't stand alone
You can count on me
I couldn't ask for
A better place to be
This can't last forever
Raise your glass together
Doesn't get much better
No better than...
This can't last forever
Raise your glass together
Doesn't get much better
No better than this
We'll fight this fight
To stay free
And never say 'Never'
If you leave this choice up to me
I'll stay up (stay up) forever
This can't last forever
Raise your glass together
Doesn't get much better
No better than...
This can't last forever
Raise your glass together
Doesn't get much better
No better than...
This can't last forever
Raise your glass together
Doesn't get much better
No better than...
This can't last forever
Raise your glass together
Doesn't get much better
No better than...
This can't last forever
Raise your glass together
Doesn't get much better
No better than...
This can't last forever
Raise your glass together
Doesn't get much better
No better than this
Weekends, are for the warriors.

And never say 'Never'
You leave this choice up to me
Ill stay up forever
Weekends, are for the warriors
