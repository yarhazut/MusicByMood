I'm over me and I'm over everything and everyone I know.
It's time to lock my doors and lose my phone.
All my friends, who needs them? I don't.
It's just funny when you look around, they think they know me like I lived and died.
So go ahead and judge 'cause I don't mind.
I got a thousand songs that say I tried.
Now I,
Don't think I can be the same,
It makes me want to change,
And go the other way.
I've been runnin' all my life tryin' to find who I am
And I'm sick of it.
Yeah, I'd give anything if I could quit.
But I can't stop until it all makes sense. (oh)
So I spend some nights just staring at the sky
Wondering why I am even here.
And I challenge, God, Himself to prove he's there,
And for a moment I don't feel so scared.
I,
Don't think I can be the same,
It makes me want to change,
And go the other way.
Don't even try to say I'm overreacting,
Cause no one ever understands a thing that I'm saying,
And not my "so-called friends" but like I already said,
I don't need them.
I don't need them.
I,
Don't think I can be the same,
It makes me want to change,
And go the other way.
I,
Don't think I can be the same,
It makes me want to change,
And go the other way.
Now I,
Don't think I can be the same,
It makes me want to change,
And go the other way.
