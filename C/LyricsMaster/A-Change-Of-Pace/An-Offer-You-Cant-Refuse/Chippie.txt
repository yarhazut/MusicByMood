I trip on my words when I hear her voice
The thoughts in my head keep running over
Again your redundant sympathy for me
Could never make me feel any better
I'm falling (I'm falling), further (further), away from you
I stumble (I stumble), still waiting (still waiting), for your answer
This is the last time you'll hear my voice
Screaming the words that never made sense
From the tears in your eyes to the smile on my face
You finally got, what's coming to you
Excessively stressful is what we've become
A burden upon which neither of us needs
The past is the past and should be left behind
The future is now, let me change your mind
I'm falling (I'm falling), further (further), away from you
I stumble (I stumble), still waiting (still waiting), for your answer
This is the last time you'll hear my voice
Screaming the words that never made sense
From the tears in your eyes to the smile on my face
You finally got, what's coming to you (coming to you... coming to you...)
Find a way to carry on
Don't think of me 'cause I'll be gone
And when the day comes to an end
You'll think of me and I'll think of you again (again... think of you again)
I'll never forget your melodic voice
This is the last time you'll hear my voice
Screaming the words that never made sense
From the tears in your eyes to the smile on my face
You finally got, what's coming to you
