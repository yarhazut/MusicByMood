Cut me open 
Let me bleed for what I've done
Tell me straight-faced 
That I'm the only one
Destroy me 
Am I not everything you need?
Don't move, don't breathe
As I take every breath from you
Know one knows what I've done
And as I wait, I'm dying (For you)
Take me out of this picture frame
Breathe slow, don't move 
As I say goodbye
Replace you 
Cross my heart I hope you die
Ripped in pieces 
You're my perfect tragedy
Know one knows what I've done
And as I wait, I'm dying (For you)
Cut me, breathe slow
Break me, tell me as I die for you, for you... 
(Know one knows what I've done)
Know one knows what I've done
And as I wait, I'm dying
Know one knows what I've done
And as I wait, I'm dying (For you)
