Should have seen this coming
Way too good
For anyone but me
Think about it
Because we know
You do
We start in December
We'll end in November
This time (This time)
We start in December
We'll end in November
This time September
Came too fast, too soon
You'll run out of lies
All options have run dry
'Cause you're alone
I hope you suffer (I hope you know)
We know
That you know
That we miss
We start in December
We'll end in November
This time (This time)
We start in December
We'll end in November
This time September
Came too soon
We start in December
We'll end in November
This time September
Came too soon
We start in December
We'll end in November
This time (This time)
We start in December
We'll end in November
This time September
Came too soon
Too soon
