Say something, anything right now
You know I'm choking on how bad it hurts
To say goodbye
Trust in the words I say to you
It's killing me to see you desperate
Believe in what you want
Just tell me how long it takes
Until I'm in the right place
Here we go again
I'm happier without this left behind
But it's all over now
I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go
Ready to find a way somehow
I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go
Ready to leave it all
Say something, anything right now
I know you're choking on how bad it hurts
To let us go
Cry yourself asleep again tonight
Write a note sent with you're love from everyone
Everyone
Just tell me how long it takes
Until I'm in the right place
Here we go again
I'm happier without this left behind
But it's all over now
I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go
Ready to find a way somehow
I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go
Ready to leave it all behind
All behind
You build me up can't break me down
I'll find a way to leave this town
And nothing good you'll ever say
Will stay with me
Please stay with me
You build me up can't break me down
I'll find a way to leave this town
And nothing good you'll ever say
Will stay with me
Please stay with me
Stay with me
Here we go again
I'm happier without this left behind
But it's all over now
I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go
Ready to find a way somehow
I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go
Ready to leave it all behind
All behind
