Asleep at the wheel, a red light mistake
Take my word for what it's worth
Life at a standstill, not one second passes
And in the asphalt I see a best friend
(Crashing through the window)
Don't move
Save me
Cry out
To god above
And would you save everyone if you saw them dying
Watch as they slip through your hands
Bring me back to life 
Bring them back to life
One step further from all of this
Abstract emotions in dealing with death
The warmth of my breath turns to ice
Beating the concrete your hands cut and bruised 
And in the end not a question of why
(Crashing through the window)
Don't move
Save me
Cry out
To god above
And would you save everyone if you saw them dying
Watch as they slip through your hands
Bring them back to life 
Bring them back to life
One step further from all of this
Never forget what I'm bleeding
Gasp for air now I am apart of this
Leave me suffering 
Never break your promises
Never forget and you'll
Never forget what I've done
And would you save everyone if you saw them dying
Watch as they slip through your hands
Bring me back to life 
Bring them back to life
One step further from all of this
Don't move
Save me
Cry out
To god above
