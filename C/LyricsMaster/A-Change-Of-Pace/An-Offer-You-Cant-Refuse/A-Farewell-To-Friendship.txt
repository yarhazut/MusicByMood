In a dream
In a place
Where the far reaches of this mind
I have seen a true nightmare
With the kiss of lovers lips
What a friendly offer
Just a memory
It still hurts
When I think that once
She was mine
Because I'm lost for words
With one last breath
For me to take from you
Now gasp for air
There's nothing left
For me to take from you
I guess it's only right
To give someone what they need
Even if it's nothing they ever
Wanted in the first place
I've seen with my own two eyes
The hurt and pain
That love causes
That's why I won't let you
Go down that road
To emotional overdose
If I had her again
Everything would be alright
But nothing's alright
And nothing's ok
When you live in a memory
I'm lost for words
With one last breath
For me to take from you
Now gasp for air
There's nothing left
For me to take from you
Just a breakdown of the heart
I'm lost for words that won't mean a thing
A tragic ending
A farewell to
A friendship that meant
Nothing at all
You let her in
You let her win
Is there anything else
To break or mend a bond as strong as ours
That wallow all through life
All through life
I'm lost for words
With one last breath
For me to take from you
Now gasp for air
There's nothing left
For me to take from you
