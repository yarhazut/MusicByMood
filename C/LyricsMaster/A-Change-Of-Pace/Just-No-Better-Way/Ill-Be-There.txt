You've felt alone since you were only seven
Your mother didn't have a clue what to do
You cried each night until you were eleven
You prayed that God would bring your daddy back to you
It got much worse when you were in high school
From guy to guy, you wondered why you never felt a thing
You wondered if you'd ever find a lover who'd someday
Get down on his knees, holding that diamond ring
This summer's taking me to California 
But I won't go until you know that what I say is true
When everything you've ever loved has left you,
I'll be there, yeah, I'll be there for you
Your senior year, you and your friends went crazy
But then you found out who your friends really were
You were betrayed by everyone that mattered
So you drank until it all became a blur
But don't forget about when I first met you
Well, I can see a pain too deep to kiss away
You thought that I would be another let down
So here I am, proving to you that I am here to stay
This summer's taking me to California 
But I won't go until you know that what I say is true
When everything you've ever loved has left you,
I'll be there, yeah, I'll be there for you
I don't wanna leave you lonely
I just wanna be right here
Even if you don't believe me,
I will try to make it clear
This summer's taking me to California 
But I won't go until you know that what I say is true
When everything you've ever loved has left you,
I'll be there, yeah, I'll be there for...
This summer's taking me to California 
But I won't go until you know that what I say is true
When everything you've ever loved has left you,
I'll be there, yeah, I'll be there for you
This summer's taking me to California 
But I won't go until you know that what I say is true
When everything you've ever loved has left you,
I'll be there, I'll be there for you
