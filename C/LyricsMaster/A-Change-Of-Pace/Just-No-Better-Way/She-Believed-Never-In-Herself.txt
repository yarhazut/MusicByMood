Come back, my dear
Come back and make my world again,
Your voice so clear, your voice reminds me of a friend
You had a heart like a hero, You sang a song that only I could ever know,
Where would I be without you, where would I be?
How could the softest heart be separated by the word goodbye?
She believed in Heaven, yeah, 
She believed in everybody else,
She believed in miracles, but never let them help
Honey, Honey take my heart like money and run,
Honey, Honey take my heart like money and run,
She believed in everybody else but never in her, never in herself
There's no denial,
You brought the world a little love,
And fought each mile, and fought the fight more than my love
It was so much bigger than a cure, it wasn't bigger than a heart that isn't sure
Where would I be without you, where would I be?
How could the softest heart be separated by the word goodbye?
She believed in Heaven, yeah, 
She believed in everybody else,
She believed in miracles, but never let them help, whoa,
Honey, Honey take my heart like money and run,
Honey, Honey take my heart like money and run,
She believed in everybody else but never in her, never in herself
I wish I could (I wish I could) give what you gave to me,
I wish I said, (I wish I said) "Please don't leave. (Please don't leave) Please don't leave. Don't leave me."
She believed in Heaven, yeah, 
She believed in everybody else,
She believed in miracles, but never let them help, whoa
Honey, Honey take my heart like money and run,
Honey, Honey take my heart like money and run,
She believed in everybody else but never in her, never in her, never in her, never in herself.
