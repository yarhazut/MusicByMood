There's something more, then something less
Yeah, it's never obvious
'Cause when I think about you,
It's like the first time
You've seen my worst
I've seen your best
It's never been as obvious
As when I think about the first time
We ever met
(Just like the first time)
She's got that temper,
But I've got that tender way to say
That we've got a problem
'Cause we know eachother all too well,
But what a contadiction
We always say we did it to ourselves
But when I'm not with you,
I can think of nothin' else
(Oh!)
It's something more, then something less
Yeah, it's never obvious
'Cause when I think about you,
It's like the first time
You've seen my worst
I've seen your best
It's never been as obvious
As when I think about the first time
We ever met
(Just like the first time)
Everything's quiet
When there's a thousand things to say
But dear, I don't buy it
'Cause I'm daring bottoms
??
We always say we did it to ourselves
But when I'm not with you,
I can think of nothin' else
(Oh!)
It's something more, then something less
Yeah, it's never obvious
'Cause when I think about you,
It's like the first time
You've seen my worst
I've seen your best
It's never been as obvious
As when I think about the first time
We ever met
It always comes back to that first time (the first time)
When every glass came with a sigh
And every boy told me to try
The timing never seemed to go right (go right)
Cause how could my love ever help,
When I barley know myself
(Oh!)
It's something more, then something less
Yeah, it's never obvious
'Cause when I think about you,
It's like the first time
You've seen my worst
I've seen your best
It's never been as obvious
As when I think about the first time
It's something more, then something less
Yeah, it's never obvious
'Cause when I think about you,
It's like the first time
You've seen my worst
I've seen your best
It's never been as obvious
As when I think about the first time
We ever met
