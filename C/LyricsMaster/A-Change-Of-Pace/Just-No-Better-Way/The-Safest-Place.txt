I take a closer look around
Shaking at the sight of what I found
Nothing is safe, nothing is where it should be
Tell me don't keep moving on
'Cause you'll regret when you find you're wrong
But I'll be the same when sanity and chaos meet halfway
Why should I find the safest place to rest my head?
Cause every time I do my dreams are left unsaid
They keep pulling, screaming begging just to take me away
Why should I try to find the safest place?
Not going to leave those doubts behind
They still seem to haunt me all the time
Nothing will go, nothing will leave me alone
I had a dream about a day when I am not afraid to look away
Or stay the same
And I will know I'm in the safest place
Why should I find the safest place to rest my head?
Cause every time I do my dreams are left unsaid
They keep pulling, screaming begging just to take me away
Why should I try to find the safest place to rest my head?
Take me away
Oh, to the safest place
Oh, oh, oh, oh...
Why should I find the safest place to rest my head?
Cause every time I do my dreams are left unsaid
They keep pulling, screaming begging just to take me away
Why should I try to find the safest place?
Why should I find the safest place to rest my head?
Cause every time I do my dreams are left unsaid
They keep pulling, screaming begging just to take me away
Why should I try to find the safest place?
