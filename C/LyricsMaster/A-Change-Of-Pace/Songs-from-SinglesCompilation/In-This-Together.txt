I know it was rough
In the beginning
Nothing was good enough
But the thought of ending
Drove us harder and harder, and farther and farther
We needed more than luck
We seen the top of the world
We've seen the bottom of it
We've had a fair share of hurts
And we got through of just the feeling again and again
Never pretending, nothing is stopping us
I know its crazy but we always find our way
I hate it when you're right
You love it when I'm wrong
Doesn't matter 'cause we're in this together
Hate it when we fight
Love it when we're on
Doesn't matter 'cause we're in this together
We can take whatever
We couldn't be any closer
But the times we disagree, it can be torture
Remember when I said that I could make it without you
I didn't get too far
You've always had my back
And I'd have yours when we'd screw up
Lost track, and got off course
So every fight, all the nights seem to be memories
And got us to where we are
I know its crazy but we always find our way
I hate it when you're right
You love it when I'm wrong
Doesn't matter 'cause we're in this together
Hate it when we fight
Love it when we're on
Doesn't matter 'cause we're in this together
We can take whatever
Even mistakes are makin' us strong
Every step, every breath it gets better
There's always a place I know I belong
No one can take what we have together
Every step, every breath it gets better
I hate it when you're right
You love it when I'm wrong
Doesn't matter 'cause we're in this together
Hate it when we fight
Love it when we're on
Doesn't matter 'cause we're in this together
I hate it when you're right
You love it when I'm wrong
Doesn't matter 'cause we're in this together
Hate it when we fight
Love it when we're on
Doesn't matter 'cause we're in this together
We can take whatever
