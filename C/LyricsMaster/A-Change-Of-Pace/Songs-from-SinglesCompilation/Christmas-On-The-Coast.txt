I'm so close
Close to standing at your front door when it gets
Cold, colder outside
And my hopes
My hopes are high for this winter to be spent
Right
Just right
Oh no
Don't forget the snow
Don't forget us here on the west coast
Please
Pack for holidays
You use these clothes, we're on our way
So many states, so many days
So many names without a face
Another town, one more night
And I won't sit, but I don't mind
All these miles left behind
This truckstop feels like home tonight
Oh no
Don't forget the snow
Don't forget us here on the west coast
Please
Pack for holidays
You use these clothes, we're on our way
I'm coming home for the holidays
I'm coming home for the holidays
I'm coming home for the holidays
I'm coming home for the holidays
Oh no
Don't forget the snow
Don't forget us here on the west coast
Please
Pack for holidays
You use these clothes, we're on our way
Don't forget the snow
Don't forget us here on the west coast
Pack for holidays
You use these clothes, we're on our way home
