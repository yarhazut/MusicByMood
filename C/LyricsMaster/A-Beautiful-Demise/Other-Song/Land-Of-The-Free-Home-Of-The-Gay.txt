Watching your face melt away on my television
My eyes lowering brings me to this blinding vision
Fuck your fashion
Fuck your protest
The rights you want
Aren't for compassion
Aren't for compassion
First this, then that
First this, then that
You can't look past what you're protesting for
To see the problems you're opening the door for
Just because you've all become desensitized to this
Does not make it fit for our country, the land of the free
And the home of the gay
Just because you've all become desensitized to this
Does not make it fit for our country, the land of the free
And the home of the gay
Our graves your digging
And you dig faster
