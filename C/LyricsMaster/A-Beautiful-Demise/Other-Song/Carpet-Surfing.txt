The skeleton kids come out to play
Glass dicks in their boney hands
Like pigs in shit they're content,
With what they live in
Like pigs in shit they're content
With the filth that they live in
You can't keep your head afloat
You can't keep your head afloat
You can't hold your breath
You can't walk that thin line
You can't run with that knife
You can't keep your head afloat
You can't hold your breath
Forever
This will kill you
This has killed you
This is you!
Nothing more
Nothing more
Nothing anymore
So now you must reap what you have sowed
And take in the consequences
Of a life that you have chose
A life of nothing but worthlessness
And mistakes you live with everyday
Well I guess the saying is true
Old habits never die
So breathe in your life
One last time
So breathe in your life one last fucking time
