With their mouths of the floor
Begging they starve
Begging they starve
But you just walk right over them
Stepping on their teeth
You can't provide for them
With your whorish ways
The lights dim once again
For you
You're center stage once again
For them
Won't you give us one last goodbye?
Won't you give us one last dance?
Won't you give us one last spread leg goodbye?
So we can end this broken night
And you can climb into your stained sheets with whom you choose
Just don't forget their cries
Just don't forget their cries
Don't forget their cries
Don't neglect their cries
Don't neglect their cries
