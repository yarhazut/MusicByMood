Every road has come to an end
And it seems as though that I've reached every one of them
And I have no words to describe how bad want to be myself
But in this mirror I see somebody else
Explorer, can you hear me?
Oh God I can hear you
I am lost again, you've seen everything in me
When I look up at this night sky
The moon and stars You set in place
Yet God you make us
Just a little lower and crown us king and queens
Is this what we're meant to be?
Explorer, can you hear me?
Oh God I can hear you
I am lost again, you've seen everything in me
Explorer, can you hear me?
Oh God I can hear you
I am lost again, Your eyes show me what You see
We all fall down to pieces
It's everything we know, we know
We all fall to pieces
It's everything we know
We all fall to pieces
It's everything, it's everything we know
Explorer, can you hear me?
Oh God I can hear you
I am lost again, you've seen everything in me
Explorer, can you hear me?
Oh God I can hear you
I am lost again, Your eyes show me what You see
