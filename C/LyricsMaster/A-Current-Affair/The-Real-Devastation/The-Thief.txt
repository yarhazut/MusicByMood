I see you from across the room
My eyes tied and ever so consumed
Oh girl, you know you've got me
I wish you all the best of luck
To catch a careless thief that broke your heart
Oh girl, you know you've got me
I feel you but your just so far away
Let's fight fire with fire so my confession's made
Oh and I'm just a thief that stole your heart from out on a limb
You be the sheriff and point out everything that I did
And I regret to say it but I killed love again
So baby just do your job and put me away for it
I'm locked up and weighted down with chains
Like a bandit, you don't know my name
Oh girl you know you've got me
You say you need some clarity to figure out what you're gonna do with me
Oh girl you know you've got me
I feel you but you're just so far away
Let's fight fire with fire so we can burn the page away
Oh and I'm just a thief that stole your heart from out on a limb
You be the sheriff and point out everything that I did
And I regret to say it but I killed love again
So baby just do your job and put me away for it
I was the thief and I know you have to send
To send a note that will put me to my end
Oh girl have mercy on my soul
Oh and I'm just a thief that stole your heart from out on a limb
You be the sheriff and point out everything that I did
You be the sheriff and point out everything that I did
And I regret to say it but I killed love again
So baby just do your job and put me away for it
