My face is buried in your hands
And I'm falling to my knees tonight
Wishing to be more than what I am
Just trying to find my place in life
Am I stuck here waiting on you?
I'm wasting away here and it's true
That what I said is something I cannot do
You've already said I'm not that strong
With everything I've done so wrong
I've already ran so far from home
Will you be the one that finds me?
It's everything you and me, it's all I can breathe in
And I'm desperate for you here tonight
You're all I am all of me everything I need in life
Can I finally find my way around the time
That I've spent here waiting on me
'Cause I'm wasting away here
You've already said I'm not that strong
With everything I've done so wrong
I've already ran so far from home
Will you be the one that finds me?
I've been lost for so long and over
The distance between me and you
You know me like I could know no other
And I'm ready to see
And I've already ran so far from home
Will You be the one that finds me?
You've already said I'm not that strong
With everything I've done so wrong
I've already ran so far from home
Will you be the one that finds me?
I've already ran so far from home
Will you be the one that finds me?
