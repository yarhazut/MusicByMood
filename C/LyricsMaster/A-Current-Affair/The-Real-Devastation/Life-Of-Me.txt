This Godforsaken little town
Well it's got me on the noose
I guess I'll lose what I will lose
What should I say?
I'm just a boy with lots to see
Wearing his whole heart on his sleeve
What's to be the life of me?
'Cause I'm hung out to dry with my arms in my chest
They had so much to say but hardly anything left of me here
(Whoa)
And I can hear you screaming
I have looked at life in all directions
Have I been misled again?
Pathetic stride, this life pretends to swallow me
Down in it's open scenery, you see my heartbeat as I breathe
Dear, what's to be the life of me?
'Cause I'm hung out to dry with my arms in my chest
They had so much to say but hardly anything left of me here
(Whoa)
And I can hear you screaming
At the top of your lungs in pain just to save me
Do you feel the way I feel?
Have you ever felt so real?
Is it cliche to say the pills I took left me no freedom?
Hung out to dry with my arms in my chest
They had so much to say but hardly anything left of me here
(Whoa)
And I can hear you screaming
At the top of your lungs in pain just to save me
