Have we forgotten
Exactly where we are at this moment in time
You put on a false face, conclusion to this case
It will never be certain
Let's kill the irony and let this be
We'll take their breath away
We are the real devastation
We are the ones that will take us down
We are the real devastation
We are the chosen
Have we been given
So much more than what we've chosen to see?
We drown in our own sin, can't make time to take in
The moments are certain
Let's kill the irony and let this be
We'll take their breath away
We are the real devastation
We are the ones that will take us down
We are the real devastation
We are the chosen
He's on the phone, she's way back home
I won't let this go, no not tonight
It's all the same, so much has changed
Oh won't let this go tonight
Let's get the heart of this war started [3x]
We are the real devastation
We are the ones that will take us down
We are the real devastation
We are the chosen
He's on the phone, she's way back home
I won't let this go, no not tonight
It's all the same, so much has changed
Oh won't let this go tonight
