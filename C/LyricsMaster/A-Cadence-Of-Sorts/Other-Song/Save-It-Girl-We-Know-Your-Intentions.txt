Fire, Fire
I'm not ready for this
Another night well spent on a hit or miss
My calloused sides are turning blue
Hold close to me as I lean to you
A subtle wink and a casual stare
Our hearts both racing, we dance on air
To speak or be spoken to? My cheeks are flushed and I'm focused on you
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you (tonight we'll rest with arms at ease)
But I'm not falling, not falling for you (tonight we'll rest with arms at ease)
I'll capture you on shores of gold
I'll sit relax as let it unfold
The pout of your soft lips and the rough graze of fingertips
So angel spread your wings
Sing something soft and comforting
I pray this finds you well
With regard I dare not tell
All of our flaws we'll dare not mention (I suppose it was mine)
Even though I had the best intentions (I suppose it was mine).
