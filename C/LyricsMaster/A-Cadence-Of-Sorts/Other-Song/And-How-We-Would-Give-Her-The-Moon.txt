If it's too much to ask tonight, I'll pen it in red, with love I will sign
I'll call you the calm before the storm, a sight for sore eyes, a heart that's been worn
Was it the wake, the bend, the fold, the crashing of tides and breaking the mold? Follow the leader, it's past ten
If I could see you, I'd softly lift your chin
I'll bare your weakeness, wear all regret, comfort and hold you, if you would only let this change
If I were to shine a light so bright, would you grace a smile and then trace the line? Leading the way back to a heart
A scrapbook collection where you've left your mark
A blueprint once saved for days with rain
A casual method to let go of pain
So here's to the step to make the most of sand and surrender
Waves breaking the shore.
