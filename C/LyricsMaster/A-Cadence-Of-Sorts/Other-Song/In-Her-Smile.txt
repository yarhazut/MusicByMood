Carved gently in these vacant halls, initials of our fate
Like the words you said to me, if not for closure's sake
So silence quenched in black and white is all that's left to trace
The dim lit light is a quiet drive, attached with daybreak's grace
It's in the way you smile at me
The softness of your hair
Maybe when you laugh outloud
The brilliance of your stare.
