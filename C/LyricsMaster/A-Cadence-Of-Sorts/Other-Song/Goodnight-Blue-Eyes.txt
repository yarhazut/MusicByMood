This is where we draw the line
Where racing hearts meet wasted time
Breath in quickly, it's now or never
Together we will rise on eagles wings
In this melody we sing
Flying faster, soaring further, love forever
Hold my hand as we drive home and at three be by the phone
Girl I'm calling
It's now or never
So goodnight blue eyes
I am here by your side
This is how we work our knuckles to the bone
Rest your head tonight
Sleep tonight
This is how we work our knuckles to the bone
So take a skeptic's chance with me and I'm confident you'll see something softer, ever fading by and better
My better half you'll be so captivate and torment me
Girl I'm calling
It's now or never
It's not too late to let me know that you're the one who will comfort me
So don't hesitate to let me know that you're the one who will set me free
Bleed me dry and take my hand
It's not too late to understand how the waves would blanket us and time would pass at this.
