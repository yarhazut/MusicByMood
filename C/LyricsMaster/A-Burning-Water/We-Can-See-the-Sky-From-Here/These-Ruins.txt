Under the amazing sun
The ingrown tone speaks
To cancel out the tears
But I remember well
Of once remembered states of emptiness
The water is rising
In your eyes to bleed and see
These empty walls are forming the tides
Inside the rediscovered sky
I only exist as the sun
In truth as the pages turn now
Of once remembered states of emptiness
The water is rising
In your eyes to bleed and see
These empty walls are forming the tides
These words of yours they say to me
There's something more you want from me
This heart you break
This life you take
I'll be in end
And with raised fists
And oceans in our eyes
We fear our fears
We fear we once controlled the sky
We fear right to the end
This one time right to the end.
