Fire burns me brighter than ever before
Water runs through these
Open door wanting to remain lock forever
I forgive words that you say
Your lies are wearing thin
I forgive words that you say
Lets move on and leave them here
Light consumes me more than you'll ever know
Don't speak so soft
Understand the beaten path you walk has over grown
I forgive words that you say
Your lies are wearing thin
I forgive words that you say
Lets move on and leave them here
So say it once to my eyes
Say that you're always, always away
There's so much you hide
Your eyes tell me so
Go back on your word and hide
So we can move on.
