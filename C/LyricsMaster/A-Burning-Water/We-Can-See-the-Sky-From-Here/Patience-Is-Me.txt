The way she moved
The way she kissed
It ended all tonight
And I know that time is ticking by
I faded out
He faded in
Your distaste for the world
Has ran the warmth from your heart
And as such
I can't believe what its become
And I feel
You look so lovely in your tears
You can't remove
You can't resolve
You wont resign
I can't define
You can't make the friction yeah (x2)
So promise me, my puzzle piece
That this is not the end
And we will meet again someday
I feel alive
I feel the end
We've known it all before
But this time it feels way too real
And as such
I can't believe what its become
And I feel
You look so lovely in your tears
You can't remove
You can't resolve
You wont resign
I can't define
You can't make the friction yeah (x2)
We'll call it quits in the middle of the night
Mistake that turned to run and not return
You'll have to hide in the darkness of this light
The puzzle piece no longer fits its place
Your tears are warm and there is no place for me
So what's left that isn't already gone
A patient heart that refuses to forgive
Believing me was the worst thing you ever did
Patience is me
It's a chance that you took
That you barely denied
This is the end
You just might lose it all
