Created picture plains with the sky permission to land or we'll dissolve into air with a heavy heart we'll mark the fiction here it's over now
We captured time and space
We made it relative
To the ocean, view of you recall
Subside single waves burn the memories inside they scream out give it one more shot exploding fragments of the makeup say we're right again
We captured time and space
We made it relative
To the ocean, view of you this is
The place where we have comethis the time when we come clean and I'll says there's always more to know why can't we save our times here
We captured time and space
We made it relative
To the ocean, view of you we call
It quits tonight
