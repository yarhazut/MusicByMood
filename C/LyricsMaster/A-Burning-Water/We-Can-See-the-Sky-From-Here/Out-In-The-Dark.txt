Lets fight the now
Light that fire and burn it down
Bring it down bring it down
We make our fate the time is now
All together all the same
It's not over it's not over
We're not the same off the shelf
It's not over it's not over
We're not the same...
HEY it's not over now
We fight with all we have
Our fates not up to you
It's not over now
We're taking over
Say it time and time again
We'll bring it down without the light
We'll play out in the dark
Lets fight the now
Light that fire and burn it down
Bring it down bring it down
We make our fate the time is now
All together all the same
It's not over it's not over
We're not the same off the shelf
It's not over it's not over
We're not the same...
HEY it's not over now
We fight with all we have
Our fates not up to you
It's not over now
We're taking over
Say it time and time again
We'll bring it down without the light
We'll play out in the dark
In the dark say now
In the dark
The time in now
We won't back down
We hold these cards
We'll burn it down
HEY it's not over now
We fight with all we have
Our fates not up to you
It's not over now
We're taking over
Say it time and time again
We'll bring it down without the light
We'll play out in the dark
In the dark say now
In the dark
What's left for them now?
