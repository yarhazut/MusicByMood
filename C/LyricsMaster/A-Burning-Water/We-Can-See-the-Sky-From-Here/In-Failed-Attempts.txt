Failed attempts in understanding
Only brought me here
Consequently I just wanted you today
Clearly it was the apprehension that stained the ceiling
Draw back the curtains so I can see
Clinching fists and crystal dreams they fall here
See through eyes just to wonder why
I just want to follow
Falling faster just to find out
Counting times you've still to mention
Give away your heart
It fades with these daydreams (x2)
I know what this meant
Your downfall still sets the stereo
See through my eyes just to wonder
Why I just want to follow
Falling faster just to find out
Counting times you've still to mention
Give away your heart
It fades with these daydreams (x2)
Your truth is all I know
Of course its just for me
I say it has to end
So listen well I will begin
You say I am over loved
I say there's nothing left to hide
The path is mine
I will decide
Give away your heart
It fades with these daydreams (x2)
