Finding you was my glory losing you was the end of my life then my mind yes I know losing you I am gone gone down this hole I will find you in my hole black hole reeks of love pelvic hole no one knows I have been here with your soul rotting inside of my skull you smell divine of maggots and wine pig eye reeks of love this is why I'm alone I need you now and your love I'll keep your bones cleaned and dry I've got my cock soiled inside of your skinless hole I know this is how we will always be as one you now are done _ will always have my fun
