Spells pacts and sacrifice, confess to me or else you'll die, she is wretch weak inside, commits her soul body and mind
Why have you come here to hate all people that god has saved...
Torches keep the night alive, the mortal mob seeks the prize, its hard to hide from the town, rabid dogs rip them down...
My wife my wife is possessed, the devil has come to suckle her breast, she dies she dies because of you, heed the ways of christian views
Now it's time for you to die, burn this bitch a thousand times, all the rest form a line, the priests have come for this child...
Fire on you is welcomes here it brings you close to Satan's lair...
Do you wish to see her rotted heart pumping thick black demons blood, it seeps deep into the fear of man, reeking havoc across the land, buried in hell a snake called desire, a kiss of this snake will burn like the lake of fire, it'll burn forever like the witches heart, my wife my wife is possessed, the devil has come to suckle her breast, she dies she dies because of you, heed the ways of christian views
