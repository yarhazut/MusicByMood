Why am I lying, what have I done, I've got this sickness in me, it's so much fun, so much fun, hold on, what have I done
This fire's brewing, the bells all ring, I need the sickness baby, I cannot breath
I cannot breath, slow die, I cannot breath
Falling on hard times this is what I need, nerves are all jumping, I've got this itch in m, my heart is pumping all this sickness through me, a hole in the crease is a secret place to be
What have I done, to my, myself alone, what have I done, slow die, this is no fun
