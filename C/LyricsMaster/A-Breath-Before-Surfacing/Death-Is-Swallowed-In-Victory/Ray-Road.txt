Upon a throne of doubt I sat
Contemplating where my life was at
And in that certain way, fate smiled
Fate smiled on me
They say such foolish dreams could never manifest into reality
They'll wish we never made a sound
We are a lack of silence
Our shadows seen on the horizon
A cloud of smoke is billowing
Why do we carry these torches around?
In hopes to burn everything to the ground
As though it never happened we'll carry on
Climbing towards the final destination
Our final resting place
Every breath that we now take
Every moment that we're awake
We can't forget we could be alone in this world
Strive for this as though it's your magnum opus
They'll wish we never made a sound
