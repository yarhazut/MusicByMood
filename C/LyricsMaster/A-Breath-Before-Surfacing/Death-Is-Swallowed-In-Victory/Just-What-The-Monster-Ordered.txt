Strange
How I can feel trapped in a room with so many exits
Overwhelming
As the air escapes my lungs
The sound of the thunder masking the footsteps
Of potential stalkers in my home
It's frightening to think of what is out there
To think I'm not alone
The paranoia has set in
My neck is stiff from looking over my shoulder every minute
Set me ablaze and extinguish me in salt
I know no rapture such as this
Tie my limbs to four separate horses
And when you see fit - crack the whip
A muffled scream is just a whisper
Intruder, string me up in your vocal cords
Sing me to sleep, I'm hanging on your every word
No one's impervious to the unknown
Nothing's innocuous after what I've been shown
