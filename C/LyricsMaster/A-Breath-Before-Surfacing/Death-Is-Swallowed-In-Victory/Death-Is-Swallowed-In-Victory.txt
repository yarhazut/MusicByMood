I crack my knuckles and let out a sigh 
The rain falls 
My face tilted towards the sky 
You must be insane if you think I have forgotten 
Not a night goes by that I don't reflect 
I'll admit that not every memory is clear 
But I don't consider that a bad thing 
I can't remember your voice 
It's lost to me 
Everyday I see your face 
It's a part of me 
I am not alone 
You have shown me the way 
The way not to be if I want to do more than watch TV 
How does it feel to be taken down a notch? 
Don't get me wrong, I miss you 
I'm just not sure how much 
The tears are welling up in anger 
For all the things you didn't do to stop the inevitable 
Everyone saw it coming 
Everyone but you 
Bastard - I'll forever be 
This name that I bear is not of my own 
The rain can't wash away the shame though it is soothing 
There's no avoiding that I reap what you've sewn 
I stand before you today 
Not a scholar nor a picture of perfect health 
How am I to teach my unborn son to be a man when I have never learned myself?
