A stain on existence they're forcing their way 
As we all sit idly we participate in all these lies and deceit 
We can't believe a goddamn thing 
They claim to help us, they'll say it's for the better 
Conveying to serve our interests while only serving to disgust 
Another serpent disguised in a suit 
We've got to burn it to the ground and expose the roots 
In all these lies and deceit 
We can't believe a goddamn thing 
We've got to punish those who filter the truth 
All fabricators shall be cleansed in flame 
Repent - don't fall for their tricks 
The only way to be free of such hypocrisy 
Ingrained within 
Our only form of solace comes from writhing in sin 
We'll dig our way out of this grave 
For too long now we've been buried in shit 
This twisting blade has been thrust in our backs 
It digs into the spine forcing the population to our knees 
Faltering, excised of our autonomy 
How long will we steady our hands before taking it back? 
Vicious, we will bring down your reign 
Grey matter, paint the walls with their disease 
Sever forked tongues from toothless smiles 
We will never swallow our pride 
Nor swallow this rubbish we've been fed
