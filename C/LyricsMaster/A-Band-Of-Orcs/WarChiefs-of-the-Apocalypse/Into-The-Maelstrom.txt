Children pick up your swords and fight
Be not afraid
A deadly calm preceds the storm
Tear yourself from your mothers' womb
Innocent no more
Into the lair of the wolves
Where legends are carved in blood
Into the maelstrom where killers are born
Raised on the blood of our own
By strength of arms and dint of steel
And warriors' hearts
We'll feast on the blood of our foes
And watch them burn
Chanting, Singinig, Praising fallen heroes
Shining, gleaming, keen-edged weapons chosen
Killing, Feasting human sacrifices
Onward, forward, come now off to war
Eminent the gathering hordes our numbers swell
How many of them can we kill before darkness falls
Black fethered circling carrion crows
Bellow the challenge; beating the drums of war
Into the lair of the wolves
Where legends are carved in blood
Into the maelstrom where killers are born
Raised on the blood of our own
"The foemen's army draws near
Lash yourself to their swords
The only thing to fear is fear"
Chanting, Singing, keen-edged weapons chosen
Killing, Giving human sacrifices
Onward, forward, come now off to war
A rushing wave of flesh and steel, will and might
Crashes against the shield wall below
Riding frenzied convulsions of rage
Mangling flesh and breaking bones
Into the lair of wolves
Where legends are carved in blood
Into the maelstrom where killers are born
Raised on the blood of our own
By strength of arms and dint of steel
And warriors' hearts
We'll feast on the blood of our foes
And watch them burn
Burn
Watch them burn
Eminent to the gathering horde
To carry out my vision
Eminent to the gathering horde
Until Domination
Eminent to the gathering horde
