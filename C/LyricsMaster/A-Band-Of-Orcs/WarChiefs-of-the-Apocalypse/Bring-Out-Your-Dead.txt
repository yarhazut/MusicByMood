Tear out your brains 
Living fantasy 
Skulls on my wall 
Adorning the bedroom walls 
All of that hate inside 
A Weapon to deploy 
I hunt in the night 
In shadows I hide and wait 
All of my deepest fantasies in one night coming true 
Bring out your dead 
Bring them to me 
Rotting flesh of corpses 
Captured souls! 
Instinct to kill or be killed 
Fulfilling my selfish will 
Searching for a fix all night 
Addicted to the flesh I seek out the weak and outcast 
They drop to their knees and beg 
They pray for a painless death 
The one they'll never get 
To be cast away 
To the pits of hell 
Never to be found 
Destiny awaits 
Buried under ground 
Never to be found
