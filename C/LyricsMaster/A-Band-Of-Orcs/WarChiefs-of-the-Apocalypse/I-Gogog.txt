My father 
My chieftain 
My leader in war 
War 
I'm standing victorious 
I'm splattered in Gore 
In Gore 
I stand above you 
And now I'm splattered in gore 
I will ascend 
Lamenting end 
Our father 
Our chieftain 
Our leader is dead 
Dead 
I, Gogog, the Bloodthroat 
And now I stand instead 
My tribe 
My Blood-kin 
Look unto me 
I set him free 
I stand above you 
And now I'm splattered in gore 
I will ascend 
Lamenting end 
All for the tribe 
All for our way of life 
We kill to take control 
Only the strong prevail 
Our kin 
I am leader 
I am leader 
I, Gogog 
I, Gogog 
I, Gogog 
God...
