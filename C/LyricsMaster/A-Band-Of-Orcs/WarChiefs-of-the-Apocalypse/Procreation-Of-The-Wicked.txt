You are blind; deny the sun and light
Whose are the objections; from where come the doubts
Evidence of infinity
Procreation of the wicked
Twist of the known
Procreation of the wicked
Serenades of opposition; absurdity, humans fate and hope
True reflections of community; procreation of the gods and lords
Evidence of infinity
Procreation of the wicked
Twist of the known
Procreation of the wicked
Cain and Abel's love and death; love and hate is what we are
Dagger and grail are; fallen of the altar
Evidence of infinity
Procreation of the wicked
Twist of the known
Procreation of the wicked
"Mysteries of perversity"
"I've killed this old man, because he limped
I've done it because he shouldn't have to do it"
If god raised the abyss; you'd procreate your own
Abolism of death is; abolism of life
Evidence of infinity
Procreation of the wicked
Twist of the known
Procreation of the wicked
