Domination!
Sinister and evil Breed
Hunting human like a fuckin' disease
Devastation spread throughout the land
Now bare witness to the master plan
Warchiefs thundering
From hell to eternity
Doom and prophecy
Through death and slavery
Behold the Warlord riding
Apocalyptic visions
Of death
The oceans burn like fire
The burning desire
A witness to the vengeance
Of hell on this earth
Global penetration
Genocidal race
A massive conflagration
The end awaits!
Pray for an end to this suffering
Reprieve from the torture and fear
Our legions have taken the citadel
In the abyss
Where the bodies of the fallen burn!
Sinister and evil Breed
Hunting humans like a fuckin' disease
Devastation spread throughout the land
Now bare witness to the master plan
Ripping the wings from an angel's back
No mercy expected or given
The heads of the righteous adorning their path
A plethora of hate and torture
An era of chaos has fallen global
As one by one the continents fall
All enemies captured and enslaved
Domination is just a heartbeat away
The oceans burn like fire
The burning desire
A witness to vengeance
Of hell on this earth
Global penetration
Genocidal race
A massive conflagration
The end awaits!
Pray for an end to this suffering
Reprieve from the torture and fear
Our legions have taken the world
One by one the continents fall
Oblivious to the power that stands before them
All that stand in the way are reduced to ashes
Armies cowered by the power of their might
Hell's Decree
Sinister and evil Breed
Hunting humans like a fuckin' disease
Devastation spread throughout the land
Now bare witness to the Master
