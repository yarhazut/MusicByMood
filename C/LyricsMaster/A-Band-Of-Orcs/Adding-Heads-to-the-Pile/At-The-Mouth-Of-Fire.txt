Standing on the edge at the mouth of fire
Ground begins to shake; flames leap higher
Death is in the air, poison gasses rise, choking dust in throat
No one can survive, burning the land of Surtur's ire
The boiling earth, the devastation, Gzoroth, hear our cry
At the mouth of fire
Where blood grants mastery over flame
Bleeding on the edge of the mouth of fire, screaming victims die
Upon grim pyre, see the funeral smoke rising to the sky
Save us from this hell, accept this sacrifice
Shield us from the wrath of Surtur's ire
The boiling earth, the devastation, Gzoroth, hear our cry
At the mouth of fire
Where blood grants mastery over flame
Beneath an ash-dark sky
My lungs burn in pain
My skin is cracking
Hot sulphur stings my eyes
Storming through the gates at the mouth of fire
Impervious to flame, we'll quench Surtur's ire
Funeral pyres burn, rising to the sky
Reavers of this hell
Dragon hear our cry
Swimming in the blood
Or this realm's sire
The boiling earth, the devastation
The Fire Lord must die
At the mouth of fire
Where blood grants mastery over flame
