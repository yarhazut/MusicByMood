Gather the tribe, sharpen your blade, raise your fist
Gore-stained axe cry out for blood
Sever the trees, feed the flames, smelt the ore
Forging weapons for brutal war
Whipping the slaves, flogging the grunts
Get them in line, send them to die
No use for prayer, only for war
Your life's a lie
March through the waste, burn through the fields
Batter the walls, giants shall fall
Bringers of pain, merchants of death
Blood flows for
Gold, take what I want
Kill, greed is our god
Spite for all giants fall
Die, too late to kneel
Whipping the slaves, flogging the grunts
Get them in line, send them to die
No use for prayer, only for war
Your life's a lie
March through the waste, burn through the fields
Batter the walls, giants shall fall
Bringers of pain, merchants of death
Blood changed for gold
Paid for the kill
Storming the walls
Conquer, destroy
The kingdom shall fall
No one is spared
The deal is off
We hate your kind
Stupid and blind
Death shall be your receipt
We repay cowards in kind
Whipping, flogging
Get them in line
Send them to die
Marching, killing
Never ask why 
You're next to die
Marching, flogging
Get them in line
Send them to die
The dying, the screaming
With the blood spilled for gold
Glory bel fill our souls
Storming the walls
Kingdom shall fall
Still the war machine rolls on
And the wheel of pain keeps on turning
Still the war machine rolls on
And the wheel of pain keeps on turning
Still the war machine rolls on
And the wheel of pain keeps on turning
Still the war machine rolls on
And the wheel of pain just keeps turning
Death you can't deceive
Death you can't deceive
Death you can't deceive
Death you can't deceive
Death you can't deceive
Death you can't deceive
Death you can't deceive
Death will your soul reap
Whipping the slaves, flogging the grunts
Get them in line, send them to die
No use for prayer, only for war
Your life's a lie
March through the waste, burn through the fields
Batter the walls, giants shall fall
Bringers of pain, merchants of death
Blood flows for
Gold, spoils of war
Kill and take more
War, harvest of blood
Domination has come
