So at last we have prevailed, the geas has been undone
One last quest left to complete before we return home
Now the Warchiefs come for you to add your head to the pile
Stacking bodies in the wall, you'll be staying awhile
When the blood on your hand is the blood on your king
You can take what you want, you can have everything
Giants rise and they fall, orcs conquer and sing
And the blood on your hand is the curse that we bring
You gave us this, the gift of hate
Lied to us, now accept your fate
The secret is out, the riddle is solved
So scream with me
Sever the heads and the soul will follow
The kingdom comes undone, how the mighty fall
With cursed sorcery, you sought to bind our souls
Well, now we come for you, my friend
To add your head to the pile
Our scorn a shield against your wall
And now I'll wipe your smile
When the blood on your hand is the blood on your king
You can take what you want, you can have everything
Giants rise and they fall, orcs conquer and sing
And the blood on your hand is the curse that we bring
You gave us this, the gift of hate
Lied to us, now accept your fate
The secret is out, the riddle is solved
So scream with me
Sever the heads and the soul will follow
Come on, put your tusks up
Put their heads on the block
Tonight we drink from their skulls
Tonight we've taken their souls
Get your tusks up
Add those heads to the pile
We'll be staying a while
Tonight we've taken their souls
And we're not giving them back
