A glowing moon, cold winter night
Sharp gleaming steel
Dark children of frost awake
Can you hear the call?
A bitter wind, so freezing cold
Brings mournful howls
Foretells the ice jarl's fate
Hear their mournful call
Howling, baying, wolf-pack screaming
Thy doom foretold
Omens fall like venom dripping
From snarling jaws
Through frenzied battles, frost and storm
Defiant, brave the strong
We bring fire, we bring the sword
We bring the Wyrd of the Winter Wolf
Into the rift, darkness descends
We thirst for blood
A clarion death knell rings
Can you hear it ring?
One last command, a futile stand
A rune for death
The gods have cast for you 
(And we heed the call)
Our feral hearts pound with cold fury
We heed the call
Blood stains the winter ice
Bright steel breaks hard
Through frenzied battles, frost and storm
Defiant, brave the strong
We bring fire, we bring the sword
We bring the Wyrd of the Winter Wolf
For death eternal
In this ice-choked world
We are the bane of life
Howling, baying, wolf-pack screaming
Thy doom foretold
Our feral hearts pound with the cold fury
Bright steel breaks hard
Through frenzied battles, frost and storm
Defiant, brave the strong
We bring fire, we bring the fury
We bring the Wyrd of the Winter Wolf
