Lost in this icy cave, can't seem to get away
Fingers and toes go numb, crystal knives cut up my lungs
Harken ahead a strange sight, dancing orbs of green light
Rising and falling again, calling us out to reckoning
Our lives are done, unless we run
Slipping and falling and screaming
And crawling and standing and falling again
Hypnotizing, beckoning, calling us out to reckoning
Listen to me, don't look in it's eyes, mesmerized
By the stare of the Ice Wyrm
Take heed, look away, don't fall prey to the glare of the Ice Wyrm
Nowhere to run, we're trapped, blind-sided by avalanche
Glacier cracking again, facing the Wyrm, only way we can win
Form up, circle in tight, confront the dragon's might
Rise up, inhaling to breathe, cold blast of ice
If it hits us we freeze
Jaws open wide, it's time to strike
Steady aiming and throwing, declaiming
Gzoroth, aid us again
Hypnotizing, beckoning, calling us all to reckoning
Listen to me, don't look in it's eyes
Mesmerized by the stare of the Ice Wyrm
Look away, don't fall prey to the glare of the Ice Wyrm
Trapped in it's gaze
Paralyzed by it's power
Unholy fear, hopeless prey to devour
Rooted in place, can't fight, cannot flee
A frozen death it is then for me
Trapped in it's gaze, test my will
Break the spell of the Ice Wyrm
Raise your tusks, raise your axe
Make a stand in the lair of the Ice Wyrm
Turn away from it's gaze
Test of will, test of strength for the tribe
Don't fall prey to the stare of the Ice Wyrm
Raise your tusks, raise your axe
Cast your spell and attack
For our tribe, for our lives
Must escape from the lair of the Ice Wyrm
