Foul, twisted
Degraded mind ensconced within degraded form
Horrid, menace
Inflicting pain for the sake of taking pleasure
Fear, torture
No rhyme or reason just a harvester of suffering
Orcs, humans
No creatures spared the ministrations of the keeper
Once noble titan
Devolving backward into depravity
Lost touch with chaos
Unleashed corruption, sowing idiotic creed
So now face the warrior
Taste the blades of retribution
Instinct directive
Destroy the horror in the keeper's chamber
Breaking wills finger by finger
Pulling tusks with iron pincers
Branding flesh with burning coals
Whips and chains against once proud foes
Tribes-kin hanging from the walls
Tortured screams heard in the halls
Imbecilic giant gloating
Strike him down to quell our loathing
Mutant, coward
No fighter here, just a spineless aberration
Echo, mirror
Soul's black reflection back at me
Must face the madness
Confront the nightmare, of our devolving breed
Declared war on nature
Became imprisoned by false mortality
So now face warriors
Taste the blades of retribution
Instinct, directive
Destroy the horror in the keeper's chamber
Kin hanging, kin dying, kin crying, kin falling
The gore-stained axe tribe will take no more
Kin rising, kin fighting, kin winning, kin chanting
Gogog, leader, release you all
