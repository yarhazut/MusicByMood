The great chieftain must fall, fall, fall
The Dread Tyrant will crawl, crawl, crawl
Screams will fill this hall, hall, hall
We will conquer all
We'll fight, we'll conquer all
On we've pushed through earth and ice
Grim with determined strength
To break this geas and free our cursed fate
To clash against the Giant King
The Lord of Fire and Stone
In magma halls burning red with hate
Armored in black, with sword of flames
He sits on an Onyx throne
In Obsidian halls, we battle to our fate
I spit upon your iron crown
I challenge you to fight
This paragon of rage you can't defeat.
You guardians we've slaughtered and left
In pools of their own blood
Eviscerated hounds of hell
The ember eyes gone black
Carcasses to wet our thirsting blades
"Hatred burning in red eyes, he rises towering from his throne"
The great chieftain must fall, fall, fall
The Dread Tyrant will crawl, crawl, crawl
Screams will fill this hall, hall, hall
We will conquer all
I fight, I conquer
Burning blades strikes fast and true
A slash upon my chest, a livid wound
I scream in oath and pain
Searing flesh and boiling blood
The stench, it makes me retch
We've come too far to taste defeat this day
I choke the noxious bile
With tightened grip on axe
My warriors flank me
Ready to engage
Don't think because you're powerful
That you will stand a chance
We come to take your head
Make no mistake
Yield, knell, die, fuck you
I stand, fight, defy
And now you gasp, bleed, fall
I'll have you beg, scream, crawl
The great chieftain must fall, fall, fall
The Dread Tyrant will crawl, crawl, crawl
Screams will fill this hall, hall, hall
We will conquer all
