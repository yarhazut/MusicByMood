Our father's not in heaven, he lies beneath our feet
World serpent coiled in darkness, entombed in torpored sleep
Ancestors swore to serve you, primeval deity
A pact long forged in bloodshed, now come the hour of need
Kill, thy will be done, strike, let the blood run
Hail, the stormbringer comes, behold the stormbringer
Kill, thy will be done, strike, in hell as on earth
Kneel, the great dragon comes, hail the stormbringer
Our fathers aren't in heaven, they rot beneath our feet
Each one killed by his own son, condemned eternally
We've paid the price in our blood, gave up our right to be free
Soul stealer, life taker, deliver vengeance to me
Kill, thy will be done, strike, let the blood run
Hail, the stormbringer comes, behold the stormbringer
Kill, thy will be done, strike, in hell as on earth
Kneel, the great dragon comes, hail the stormbringer
Let the blood run, let the blood run
Let the blood run, still the blood runs
Feel the blood run
Our mother, womb of chaos, bring forth your vile seed
Inchoate spawn are legion, summoned to hateful deeds
Ancestors bound and chained you, imposed severity
A chain long forged in bloodshed, unbound chaos be free
Kill, thy will be done, strike, let the blood run
Hail, the stormbringer comes, behold, the stormbringer
Kill, thy will be done, strike, in hell as on earth
Kneel, the great dragon comes, hail the stormbringer
Your new father is not in heaven
Your new father lies beneath your feet
Your new father, coiled in darkness
Your new father embraces you in torment
