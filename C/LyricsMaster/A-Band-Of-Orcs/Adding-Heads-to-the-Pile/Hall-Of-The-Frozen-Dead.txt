Descend into the realms 
Where the secrets of the dead stay unspoken
Darkness all around, blackness strangles you
Gasping, choking
Enter if you dare, into this dismal land of fear
Hear death calling
Sickening tableaux, shrieking of the soul
Frozen in time
Dead soulless eyes, stare down at you
No secrets spoken, in the Hall of the Frozen Dead
Bold deeds forgotten, in the Hall of the Frozen Dead
Life-force drains away as the fear creeps up your spine;
You are dying
Warriors trapped and lost, frozen in their icy tombs
Eternal, the darkness
Agony twisted forms; rictus staring grins
Accusing
Never lived to tell their tales, never 'scaped to breathe again
Weapons unwielded 
Unrest forever, entombed in darkness, lost
No secrets spoken, in the Hall of the Frozen Dead
Cold lips silent forever, in the Hall of the Frozen Dead
Darkness deadly cold, rigid fingers clutching stone
Feel death grasping
The chill of dread, the stench of death
Torches flicker, panting breath
No use running
Bodies in the hall, the dead are moving in the walls
Hear ice breaking
Undead begin to crawl, zombies stalking, hunts us all
Dread evil rising
Deadly cold
Trapped forevermore, in the Hall of the Frozen Dead
Hearthfrost abounds, in the Hall of the Frozen Dead
Savagery and gore, in the Hall of the Frozen Dead
Never to betray, in the Hall of the Frozen Dead
Dead, soulless eyes, stare down at you
The Dead rest forever, forever trapped in gloom
No secrets spoken, in the Hall of the Frozen Dead
No quarter given, never to be free
No salvation
Neither glory
No forgiveness
Only death
Trapped forever more, in the Hall of the Frozen Dead
Search for escape, in the Hall of the Frozen Dead
Seeking the way, in the Hall of the Frozen Dead
Eight warriors slain, in the Hall of the Frozen Dead
Losing your way, in the Hall of the Frozen Dead
Never be free, in the Hall of the Frozen Dead
