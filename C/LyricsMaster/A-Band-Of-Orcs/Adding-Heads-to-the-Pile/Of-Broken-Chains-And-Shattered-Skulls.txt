Rise up, break free
Take your chains in your hands
Rise up, follow me
Shattered skulls of the Tyrant Kings
All rise now and break free
Take those chains in your hands
All rise up, come and follow me
Shattered skulls of the Tyrant Kings
Shadows on the wall
World which you see, illusion
Out beyond the cave
So much more to see
Wide open
Gave up your life
Gave up your death
Gave up your everything
When you acquiesced
All you see in this cave is a lie
Smoke and flames and shadows to hide
The burning world that waits outside
The only truth; take back your life
Rise up, break free
Take your chains in your hands
Rise up, follow me
Shattered skulls of the Tyrant Kings
What are chains and flesh compared to being free?
Deception
Take your chains in hand, come and follow me
Rebellion
Why die a slave, when you can die free?
This moment, sing of broken chains, shattered skulls of kings
Redemption
You have a choice
Give up, or fight
This is your time
Now fight for your life
All you see in this cave is a lie
Smoke and flames and shadows to hide
The burning world that waits outside
The only truth is to take back your life
So you bleed, and you suffer
And your toil make them richer
Still you bleed, more you suffer
And your toil makes them richer
You'll always bleed, always suffer
While your toil makes you nothing
When you bleed, when you suffer
Make sure it makes you stronger
All you gave was the rest of your life
Blood and tears and sweat to survive
All they took was the best of your life
The time is now to take back your life
All you gave was the rest of your life
Blood and tears and sweat to survive
All they took was the best of your life
All you gave and got were for lies
Lies, were for lies
Lies, was for lies
Lies, fucking lies
Lies
