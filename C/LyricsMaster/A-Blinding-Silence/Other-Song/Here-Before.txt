Here we are, on an old familiar road...
We've been here before done this before, oh
Seen this shit before we quit this once before.
Here I stand killing myself again...
All roads lead to here; I'm bleeding from my soul,
Can't just leave it there, my heart beating on the floor.
Here I stand... no closer to you.
(Here we are)
Where we swore we'd never again go.
(Here we stand)
Undecided in the middle road.
Here we are, circled back to silence...
I can't look at you; this cuts me to the bone
So much beauty there my heart has turned to stone.
Here I stand, wish you'd just let me fall...
Wish you'd let me go let darkness enfold
There's no difference there I've been here once before.
Here I stand... no closer to you!
(Here we are)
Where we swore we'd never again go.
(Here we stand)
Undecided in the middle road.
Here we are on an old familiar road...
We've circled back to those old haunts we know
Let's start something new...
I have wept you from my heart
I have bled you from my soul.
That's a road that I don't know...
I would rather be nothing,
Than a shadow of what was...
So why can't I just let go?
