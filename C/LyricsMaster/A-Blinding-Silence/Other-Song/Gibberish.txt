I saw you, standing there
Eyes so bright
I thought I'd die.
A flame, inside of you.
I caught you,
Looking back
Lost my breath
A heart attack exploding
Inside of me.
Shadows of you linger
Memories like paper cuts
Kisses like winter
Inside me like splinters
-Of you.
I'm tongue tied,
Standing here
There you are
Without a care just smiling
Into the sun
The words come
From out in space
Language unknown
Told by your face
It tells me
Just what I want.
To hear.
