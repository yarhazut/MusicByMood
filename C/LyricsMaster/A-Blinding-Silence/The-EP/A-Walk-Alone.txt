Cheers to life...
And moments when they define
What broken hearts can't deny.
And to hope
Sincerest in it's design
Yet manifested to blind
And my eyes, they can't always see the lie
Yeah sometimes it's hard to find
And what more do you want from me 
I've given every part of me.
The closest things are hard to see.
Here's to spite
Vindictive in it's design
The shallowest part of mind
Cheers to love
The ocean that does divide
But sometimes it's hard to find
And what more do you want from me 
I've given everything you see.
The closest things are hard to see
And my eyes, 
They can't always see the light
Yeah sometimes it's hard to find
And my eyes,
They can't always read your mind
Yeah sometimes it hard to fight
In my head I kill the lie, I kill the lie
In my head I kill the lie, I kill the lie and walk alone 
And my eyes, they can't always see the lie
Yeah, sometimes it's hard to find.
