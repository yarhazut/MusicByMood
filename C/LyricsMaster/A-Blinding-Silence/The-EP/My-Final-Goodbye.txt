This is my final answer
Please listen to me
For eyes cannot hide the world
Please see more than words
You want more than I can give
More than what I am
You hurt more than you live
You breathe to die
(Let me go)
You're searching for an answer
That you already know
And would rather cut yourself open
Than to just let go
I'm looking for an exit
Any port in a storm
(Let me go)
This is my final goodbye
Please listen to me
The pas cannot save our future
And now is lost
You want more than I can give
More than what I am
You hurt more than you live
You breathe to die
(Let me go)
You're searching for an answer
That you already know
And would rather cut yourself open
Than to just let go
I'm looking for an exit
Any port in a storm
(Let me go)
This is my final goodbye...
