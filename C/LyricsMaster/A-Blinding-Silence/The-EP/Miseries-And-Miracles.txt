And I don't believe in miracles.
A light can only shine for so long
Then it fades away
And I'm failing inside
And the shadows my eyes
Find are blinding and breaking me.
And I don't believe in miracles
A love can only fight for so long
Then it fades away.
Even love must expire
And the hurt kills my eyes
It is blinding and breaking me
And I never stop to smell the rose.
The thorns can only sting for so long
Then it fades away 
Even hurt has to die
Just the blink of an eye
And I know nothing gold can stay
And I never stop to smell the rose
An ache by any other name
Would still kill me the same
I am darkening inside
And this absence of light
It is blinding and breaking me
And I'm fearing that we're on our own
A heart can fight for so long then it tears away
Leaving absence of doubt and a soul crying out 
That there must be a better way 
And I'm looking for a miracle
A life can only fail for so long then it must be saved
A light shining so bright intervening divine 
Be it blinding
