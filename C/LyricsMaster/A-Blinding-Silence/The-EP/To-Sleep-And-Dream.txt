It's not ok to die now, there is no letting go.
A fate isn't sealed with an angel's kiss, this is your dream.
And I'm holding this close, words and whispers and hope.
I'm believing in you if no one else will.
Just accept this as true
And come lay with me
Let the dream fall from your open lips today
Oh, scream me a love lullaby reverie
And I swear that it won't
Be the death of you
If you dream.
Fuck what they have to say
And forget about yesterday
Color in your eyes and disregard the pain
And I'm sending you hope
Through the wire and the waves.
It's not ok to pause now, there is no giving in...
I'm whispering every word just for your eyes.
And I'm feeling this too, the tide threatening to drown me out
I'm believing in you if no one else will.
Just accept this as true
And come lay with me
Let the dream fall from your open lips today
Oh, scream me a love lullaby reverie
And I swear that it won't
Be the death of you
If you scream...
Fuck what they have to say
And forget about yesterday
Color in your eyes and disregard the pain
And I'm sending you hope
Through the wire and the waves.
Who are they anyway?
But failed dreamers standing in your way
More statue than alive, more dead than awake
Oh, I'm sending you hope
Through the wire and the waves
Say with me...
I won't fall down and die.
I won't just curl up and die.
