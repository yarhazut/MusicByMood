Skipping streets in springtime
Chasing sunlight on my bike
And I could chalk the sidewalk
Any color that I liked
Blowing dandelions
Fairground rides and climbing trees
And mother's kiss or candy
For every injured knee
There are no action heroes out there
To come and save the world from harm
Superman can't move his legs
And I can't use my arms
Superman can't move his legs
Grandma's cake and candles
Magic bean plants in a jar
Shared baths and bedtime stories
From Prickly Leg to Matthew Star
Sleeping Beauty's sleeping
I'm not the boy I used to be
Surrounded by the bad guys
The only fairy here is me
There are no action heroes out there
To come and save the world from harm
Superman can't move his legs
And I can't use my arms
Superman can't move his legs
I don't know much but
If I've learned something from the past
It's: girls go for assholes
And happy endings never last
There are no action heroes out there
To come and save the world from harm
Superman can't move his legs
And I can't use my arms
Superman can't move his legs
