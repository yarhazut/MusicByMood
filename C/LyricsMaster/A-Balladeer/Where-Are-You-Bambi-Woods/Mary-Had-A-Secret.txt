We met at redhead Mary's house on a Bible study night
I heard she was a rebel once until she saw the light
Then in the backseat of a crowded car after weeks of holding hands
She was slipping me the tongue among her Christian friends
We could chuckle and talk for hours
And then one night over the phone
She went and told me her best friend's secret
After she had lowered her tone
It was all about forgiving and so
She thought that God would want me to know
Her older sisters had both moved out and her parents were divorced
Her mother lived in a trailer park, not big, but she had a porch
And on top of the piano laid a cat with evil paws
Her father he was a proud Nam vet I think she hardly saw
We would chuckle and talk for hours
And then one night over the phone
She went and told me her best friend's secret
After she had lowered her tone
It was all about forgiving and so
She thought that God would want me to know
The old piano she could play so nice she had later sadly sold
The money was invested in the church her husband owned
She had a kid when I looked her up and another on the way
And when we waved our last goodbye she said that she would pray
