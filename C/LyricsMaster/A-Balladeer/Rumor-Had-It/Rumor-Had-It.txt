Rumor had it you'd move abroad
About a year ago
This guy from work
He knows this girl you know
So I guess you finished school
And you got your degree
The ostrich thing worked for you
Now let it work for me
It is not like I could care
You do what you have to do
If you're happy over there
Good for you - good for you
The rumor has just been verified
By your friend today
My face turned red
When he brought up your name
He talked about his trip
And how he looked you up
He said where you live now
How I wished he had stopped
It is not like I could care
You do what you have to do
If you're happy over there
Good for you - good for you
I don't wonder - I suppose
You still live with those theories of yours
And, of course, that
What's his name knows
