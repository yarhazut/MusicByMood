And here I am again
Crying
Back again
Trying to think clear
But it's hard to see straight
Through slowly flowing tears
Please, let these be
Left-over tears, lost
These have to be
Left-over tears - they must
And there you were again
Sitting
On my couch again
Hitting on my memories
It used to be too small
Now there's place enough for three
These have to be
Left-over tears - they just must
Please, let these be
Left-over tears, lost
And there I am again
Swearing
