Sam here says he lost his call 
On the day Cousteau had died 
The ocean was a tub of sharks 
With Jacques Yves as a guide 
Sam here says the water's safe 
That man should not have left the seas 
Called the Human Bathyscaphe 
He's King of Expertise 
So if someone wants to know 
And asks you where I am 
You say you saw me go 
For a swim with Sam 
Sam here says they call him "nice" 
And that it makes him really sick 
That his "nice" is like "polite" 
And silence does the trick 
Sam here says he'd like to go 
Somewhere far away from here 
To a sea that no one knows 
To completely disappear 
So if someone wants to know 
And asks you where I am 
You say you saw me go 
For a swim with Sam

Don't try to talk me out of this 
Not while I'm here in Carla's seat 
"The sea has many drops of water 
But the salt won't let you taste the sweet" 
(2x) 
Don't try to talk me out of this 
"Don't go, don't go, don't go ..." 
Not while I'm here in Carla's seat 
"Don't go, don't go, don't go ..." 
(2x)
