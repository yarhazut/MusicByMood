Look at you now
In such a rush but one big step behind
You need a clue now
All blinded by the gypsy of your mind
If you give me your hand - I'll do what I can to get you calm
By making up the meaning of the lines in your palm
Look at you now
Uptight and denial for a while
You look like shit now
It's the tears of things and halb so schlimm
Come on, show me that smile
And give me your hand - I'll do what I can to get you calm
By making up the meaning of the lines in your palm
Look at you now
