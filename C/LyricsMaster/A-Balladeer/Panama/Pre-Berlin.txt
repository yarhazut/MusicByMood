Just a perfect day (for this time of year)
We're making away with right in the rear
An Indian Summer sun, red
Berlin ahead
The sky so pretty through the open roof
And I so witty - your laughter, my proof
All your glee
Through your hand on my knee
The memory's alive tonight
The driver's seat feels quite alright
And I don't know what it is
But I think I could get used to this
The lamppost lights are a canopy of stars
But you on my right you light up the car
The road and me
Your hand on my knee
More on than off it distracts my pedal foot
As we fall in love with Parachutes
Yeah, we do -
Yeah, we do
The memory's alive tonight
The driver's seat feels quite alright
And I don't know what it is
But I think I could get used to this
I am aware and sad somehow
This is here, this is now
How I love to be in this state we're in
Right before we take Berlin
Before we take Berlin
We're moving too fast
Let's take another five
I'd just like it to last
This six hour drive
A few hours more
Snacks and gas galore
The memory's alive tonight
The driver's seat feels quite alright
And I don't know what it is
But I think I could get used to this
I am aware and sad somehow
This is here, this is now
How I love to be in this state we're in
Right before we take Berlin
Don't tell me you don't feel this, too
