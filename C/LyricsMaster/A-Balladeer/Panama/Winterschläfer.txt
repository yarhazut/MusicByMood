That was your mom who I just informed
Now go back to bed while it's still warm
Not one thing you need that is not in this lair
Lay down your arms - you're under my care
Close those eyes
Goodnight-night to you
Go and doze off
This cold winter through
And see what time will do
Let's pull up a chair now Janosch is here
For Ich mach dich gesund, sagte der BÃ¤r
And when you're fast asleep I will play with your hair
Through my tears I will breathe you're under my care
Close those eyes
Goodnight-night to you
Go and doze off
This cold winter through
The curtain's drawn
The sun long gone
Close those eyes
Goodnight-night to you
No, I won't take
A straight no from you
And when spring arrives we will have to see
If you're sick of life or - maybe - me
