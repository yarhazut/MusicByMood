So spring never came
No need to digress
It is what it is
And this too shall pass
Now summer has gone
You need a new plan
Before you know it
It's winter again -
All over again
You'll be alright
I know for a fact
Just look at the twins
Remember the pact
And then there's this blonde
Still a bit tanned
Maybe it's time now
You let go of his hand
Go on...
