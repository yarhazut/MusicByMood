So here we go again
Straight into reverse
Now that I have made these scenes
I could hardly make it worse
But I hate to see you 'happy'
How you've gotten on with life
And bored with me so quickly
It hurts, but I tell you that
It's that blank that kills me
So here we go again
If you think to know this tale
Go on and roll your eyes
Or bite a bitten nail
How I hate to see you like this
Thinking that you're all that
Yes, I hate to see you like this
It hurts, but I tell you that
It's that blank that kills me
Yes, still
How I hate to see you like this
Thinking that you're all that
Yes, I hate to see you like this
It hurts, but I tell you that
It's that blank that kills me
I'm thinking that you're all that
