A whole new world
A whole new world
That's what we'll see
That's what we'll see
I'm looking for
1 tug
The pull of a planet
1 tell
A wobbling sun
I've searched for years
Haven't found a one
But they're out there
1 jump
In radial redshift
1 slip
Of spectral lines
They'll see if I can show them the sines
Pish tosh
Green men
Take five
Take ten
Just a little cash guys
Budget's tight
Don't fund this trash guys
I can take a hint
Better face the facts
Second-hand'll have to do
Eww
All you planet hunters at the bottom
You've got fact and fantasy entwined
Finding planets except they haven't got one
Well they gotta be forming readily
When you think about it given we've got nine
1 jump
A blip in the spectrum
1 shift of meters per second
1 graph of period power
They laugh but I'm not sour
Here goes
18 months of data
Cross and correlate it
All I gotta do is run
Pish tosh
Green men
Ah don't mind them
If only they'd look closer
Would they see a pure void
No sirree
They'd find out
There's worlds galore
To see
Make way for Pegasi
51 Pegasi
First was a world
Round an old pulsar
That's true
But the news
Is a sun-like star
With wobble
Too quick and precise
To be designed
No fluke not a spot
If you like it hot
You're gonna love this find
Pegasi 51b
Planet discovered
Orbit traced
Every 4 days
Hot as can be
Its order-Jupiter size
Was something of a surprise
Especially given its star's proximity
Pegasi 51b
It's a new era
To detect
Exoplanets
Soon there'll be three
As planet pulls on its Sun
It shifts the stellar spectrum
That's how we found 51b Pegasi
How'd a planet get so close in orbit
'Cause I thought you needed ice to form it
Did it later undergo some strange migration
Star too small to be so long-pulsating
And too old to be so quick rotating
Is there any other good interpretation
This will certainly help with our funding
We got your funding
We got your funding
Got a surface of 1200 C
It's treacherous
So treacherous
If in time this new breakthrough feels mundane
Planets are common
That's proof
Of the truth
I've been telling you
This is no mean anomaly
Pegasi
Pegasi
Pegasi 51b
Planet uncovered
Round a far
Main-sequence star
Spectral type G
We know its mass to be high
Half Jupiter by sine i
It's 15.61 parsecs from home
And it shakes our faith in how the planets are formed
And its star is in Pegasus
Give it an A and thus
Label the planet as b
51 Pegasi
Well
Plotting Doppler shifts is glacial-pace
And that astrometry never prevails
But baby you're in luck cause
Up in space
You got a planet finder never fails
You got the power of statistics now
You got a view without an atmosphere
So no more nights spent locked up in your tower
All you gotta do is wait right here
And I say
Kepler the planet searcher
Got a dip, no 2, no 3
We just measure brightness
Plot it out and that's transiting photometry
Hey hey hey
My, my
Oh no
You got a planet there
When your stars do this
And your curves displace
Then your star's got this
Transiting its face
Then you hit compute
And lookie here
You get good diameter data
From that dip
And orbit distance from the length of year
Well now we need this tale supported by
A ground observer with a good Ã‰chelle
We got 2000 planets certified
2000 more that only time will tell
But let's take 'em all, plot 'em out
And find out if we're really all alone
Is there a rocky world we've found no doubt
That orbits in the habitable zone
Like home?
Kepler the planet searcher
Got an Earth 452b
Part of a throng
40 billion strong
There ain't never been a field
Clever as the field
There ain't never been a field
Better than the field they call
Exoplanetology
Exoplanetology
I can show you a world
A shining shimmering planet
Found concealed in the band shifts
Of the closest star in sight
And I've found hope in the skies
And facing wonder I wonder
Could the sine wave discovered
Be a planet fit for life
A whole new world
A new fantastic point of blue
Placed in that narrow zone
Where water flows
Midway tween cold and steaming
A whole new world
Its sun a faint, reddish hue
Could there be waiting here
A biosphere
Evolving in this whole new world to view
Fathoming a whole new world to view
Unbelievable find
Indescribable feeling
Earthlings someday revealing
Through directly captured light
A whole new world
Don't just stare from afar
Though nigh impossible to see
Wouldn't close up be bolder
Next to its parent's flare
If life is there
We'll know through atmosphere spectroscopy
A whole new world
Block the glare of the star
A laser starshot to pursue
With a star-shaped occulter
Chasing that crazy dream
That's always been
Of walking in a whole new world with you
A whole new world
A whole new world
That's where we'll be
That's where we'll be
A thrilling chase
A home in space
For you and me
A whole new world
