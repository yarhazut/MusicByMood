Some silent kid in a shopping cart from a parking lot
Think we've seen him before
We're humming along to the radio song, don't know what's going on
Think we've heard this before
You think you know what you want
Is this really what you want
An ugly girl with the bleach color hair, that suburban flair
Think we've seen her before
Another killer loose, brand new mother goose, we know what's going on
Think we've heard this before
We're humming along to the radio song, don't know what's going on
Think we've heard this before
You think you know what you want
Is this really what you want
