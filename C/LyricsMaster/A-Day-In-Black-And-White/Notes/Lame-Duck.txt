No control and no real role
To make a mind, to make in kind
Impossible, impractical
To imagine it different
Safe guard the things you want
You didn't choose; they chose you
Sit with patience and wait for
Something you know, you know
Multiply the wait, divide the time
Can't be blamed for what you don't know, you know
Sit with patience and wait for something you know, you know
When you're not sleeping we're keeping secrets
We've got no problems; is that a problem
