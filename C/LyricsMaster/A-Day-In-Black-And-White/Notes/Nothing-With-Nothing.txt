What was it that you wanted to say
Smeared in pencil, couldn't read it anyway
Got the trash and the bottles in bags
Some old boxes with notebooks in frames
I've got it written down
So I can show you now
I've got it written down
So I can read it now
You may find that you'll never come undone
Like you're supposed to before you start your famous run
Just because there may be flowers in your hair
Doesn't mean you have to pretend that you just don't care
When all the other kids have given up for the night
There's always more out there looking for a light
On the shore where the Margate sands go out
You never never never never ever had a doubt
