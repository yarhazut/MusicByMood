This time it's not for show it's different
One more failed atempt, indifference
Every block is another way to see it straight
Last word every time and don't be late
Strange record of stunted growth
Wordplay and meaningless
I've got to find the pieces
I've got to describe them all
To find any final connection
To play, to play along
