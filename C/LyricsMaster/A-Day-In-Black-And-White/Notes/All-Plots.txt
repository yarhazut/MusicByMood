Now when it rains it always pours
As if it's going to last forever
How are we supposed to talk when you're always
Staring at your feet as if they're tied together
And when it falls apart
It's not like we're making much more than nonsense
And when you're sick of me I'll ride the bus for days
Until I run out of ideas
When you say direction do you mean to say reflection
I know you're always seeming, but you never catch my meaning
