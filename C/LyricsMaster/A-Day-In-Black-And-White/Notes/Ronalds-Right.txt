There's a man upstairs writing something down
I couldn't read some kind of hieroglyphic
Answer you phone or return my letters as if it's all the same
So read your bill
You always overpay
Heard that before
Like everything else you say
Save your nickels and save your dimes
'Cause we don't want to wait in line
