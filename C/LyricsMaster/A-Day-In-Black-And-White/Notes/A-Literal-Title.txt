You have to be careful what you say
You have to be careful with what you do
That's what you said
That's what you said to me then
Hey did you hear that somewhere else
Or did you make it up just for me
That's what you said
That's what you said to me then
Sometimes a passing car and then I sang
Sometimes a TV billboard then I sang
Do the same every day
Hum to myself as I waste away
