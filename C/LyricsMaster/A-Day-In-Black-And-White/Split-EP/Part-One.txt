You can say what you will but your words won't commit themselves to meaning.
You can scream until you're blue in the face and still not be making sense.
You can say what you will but your words won't commit themselves to action.
You can scream until you're blue in the face and still not be making changes.
Be careful where you look, they're always stealing something- its how they eat, how they sing, how they dance that kills me.
Stay in the boat and please don't rock it- they may have sticks and stones but we have invisible bullets.
This farce, but so are these people.
With the way they die we'll have to keep on blasting.
The world may seem upside down- this is what transgression looks like.
Maybe that's just what's meant- but it all seems out of place here.
And I guess we never heard how to find our way out.
And I guess we never learned how to question ourselves.
We'll keep coming one at a time.
The horror is that which cannot be said.
