Beyond these troubled eyes that burn
I'm feeling betrayed about
Believing all those lies
That was the worst mistake I made
It would've been much easier to tell what's on your mind
Because I'm sick of all your troubles
And I'm sick of all your lies
I'm leaving for good
Just then I understood what made me build up fear inside
You threw me on the ground
And that's when I had found you burned right through my worried mind
I look over the hilltop that I've
Never dared to cross because
I know it can't be right
But then to my surprise
I see me calling out with cries about
Demanding all your trust
I'm leaving for good
Just then I understood what made me build up fear inside
You threw me on the ground
And that's when I had found you burned right through my worried mind
