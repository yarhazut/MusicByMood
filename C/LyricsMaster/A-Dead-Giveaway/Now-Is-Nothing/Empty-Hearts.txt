Tomorrow, the sun won't rise for her
This flat line depicts her guts and glory
Arguments constrain her thoughts
On this beach of broken glass
The lights go out
And she can't find herself, because this love has left her
Blind
All these nights are lost
This is her SOS to you
She takes her last breath out of the barrel
Her life has ended now
Cancel my subscription
To this lifetime of memories
The lights go out
And she can't find herself, because this love has left her
Blind
All these nights are lost
This is her SOS to you
She hits the floor
The light in her eyes burn out
Like a candle in the betraying wind
Her ending sounds so sweet
In the ears of no one else
