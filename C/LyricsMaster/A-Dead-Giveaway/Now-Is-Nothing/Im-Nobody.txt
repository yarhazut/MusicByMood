Pure rage deep inside
Trying to tell me what I've known
And what I've done
Pitch black shadows and bleach bright lights
They're all the same
They won't stop the fight
I'm lost in the dark alleys
Trapped inside my unclear mind
Because I seem to be nobody
Because my soul was left behind
It all flew past my eyes
Disguised in unclear thoughts and lies
Because of all I know, it couldn't have been true
Everything disappeared
Without a clue
What can I do?
Sanity leaving me of my sins
They're blown away
With the slightest winds
I'm lost in the dark alleys
Trapped inside my unclear mind
Because I seem to be nobody
Because my soul was left behind
It all flew past my eyes
Disguised in unclear thoughts and lies
Because of all I know, it couldn't have been true
