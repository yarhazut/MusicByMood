Why did it have to fall?
Why did it have to end like this?
The only thing that's gone
Would be the only thing I miss
You said it like before
That it won't matter anymore
When I looked up to the sky
Why did you have to say goodbye?
The only thing that mattered
Were the things you never said
And look where that got me
You might as well just call me dead
The only way to fight this battle for eternity
Is for you to come back home and end this war inside of me
You had to let it go
Just tell me why I couldn't know?
The anger held inside, no longer has a place to hide
I hang my head down low
Just so you know I won't let go
Of the anger held inside
Why did you have to say goodbye?
The only thing that mattered
Were the things you never said
And look where that got me
You might as well just call me dead
The only way to fight this battle for eternity
Is for you to come back home and end this war inside of me
