The sky is getting darker and the clouds begin to fall
The minutes pass like years, and I am here without a cause
I sit here wasting my life away and now I'm all alone
You pushed me down, I got back up
So now it's time to feel the burn
I see the silhouettes; hide behind the shadows we once knew
Lies behind your silver breath of a troubled mind that never grew
The sky has turned pitch black, and now the clouds are burning red
The fog is getting denser as my will begins to fade
I know what I must do to make this hatred go away
I'm going to make you know what it's like to live inside of me
I see the silhouettes; hide behind the shadows we once knew
Lies behind your silver breath of a troubled mind that never grew
The silhouettes, burned across the midnight sky
You won't live to see my hatred die
I'll rip your heart straight from your chest
My tortured soul will be at rest
