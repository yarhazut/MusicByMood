As your eyes bleed red
The blinding sun resides
Under this blanket of time
Can you find your heart?
Beneath it's killing beat
The blood will choke you
From the words you scream
So cut along this dotted line
And watch my veins run dry
The catastrophic ending, to this fairytale of hate
Has lost its mind
So cut along this dotted line
And watch my veins run dry
So let the tears turn to fire
And watch my eyes burn
Until there's nothing left of me
Now it's too late to take it back
And say that it's okay
I never really wanted this
You wanted it your way
So cut along this dotted line
And watch my veins run dry
The catastrophic ending, to this fairytale of hate
Has lost its mind
So cut along this dotted line
And watch my veins run dry
