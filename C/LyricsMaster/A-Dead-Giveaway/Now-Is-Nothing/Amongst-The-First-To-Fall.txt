Now I've come, way too far
To just give up and fall apart
Now I see, what's deep in me
I'll take this blade right to my cheek
It can't be far, this constant sorrow
That hangs upon this tinted window
A memory, that calls my name
Now I'm the one that casts the flame
I've come this far, to see it all
Now I'm amongst the first to fall
You've kept me here, by myself
It won't be long, to say goodbye
Now I've gone, way too far
To just give it up and fall apart
Now I've seen, it's deep in me
I took this blade right to my cheek
The misery you pulled me through
I cannot seem to get to you
A memory that called my name
Now I'm the one that takes the blame
I've come this far, to see it all
Now I'm amongst the first to fall
You've kept me here, by myself
It won't be long, to say goodbye
