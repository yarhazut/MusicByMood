Remember the things you said to me,
When we were on the phone,
Don't ever think you're crying to be left alone,
Ambitions still flying against yourself
You'll never know
The ones you love will often come and go
The passion you put behind yourself unknown
To those who never take the chance to let it show
Each time we go out on our own,
To play those silly games you play with me,
I can't forget,
Tonight ill ask myself again,
Why did I ever change the way I felt? I felt for you
So quiet, I wait impatiently
But you havent cared
Another apology has left me unaware
For something to come unexpectantly
I dissappeared, you think that people would know after all these years
Where have I left? where have I gone?
Will no one know?
To find the answers that will come along
Each time we go out on our own,
To play those silly games you play with me,
I can't forget,
Tonight ill ask myself again,
Why did I ever change the way I felt? I felt for you
Cry, cry, cry
Each time we go out on our own,
To play those silly games you play with me,
I can't forget,
Tonight ill ask myself again,
Why did I ever change the way I felt? I felt for you
Each time we go out on our own,
To play those silly games you play with me,
I can't forget,
Tonight ill ask myself again,
Why did I ever change the way I felt? I felt for you
