Passing on
One of lifes most precious lessons we learned today
Beyond our souls' decay
You wander past the rolling side to see the light (to see the light) of everything you've dropped and fell behind
To fly away (to fly away)
Its hard to feel alive
When the ones you love are right there by your side
To make you feel all right (make you feel all right) when you see things out tonight
Just remember those who follow close behind when we let ourselves unwind (let ourselves unwind) and it's a hard day when you inwind and finding light to let you go inside there's many to collide and we can't be gone for a long time and we cannot wait for anything at all
Anything at all
We've all been loved anything we've held
Let down or betrayed
To hide our souls away we wander past this in disguise to see the light (to see the light)
Of everything we've dropped or fell behind
To fly away (fly away) its hard to feel alive
When the ones you love are right there by your side
To make you feel all right (make you feel all right) when you see things out tonight
Just remember those who follow close behind when we let ourselves unwind (let ourselves unwind) and it's all the same when you inwind that the lines we made are meant to go inside
Theyre many to collide and we can't be gone for a long time and we cannot wait for anything at all
Anything at all its hard to feel alive
When the ones you love are right there by your side
To make you feel all right (make you feel all right) when you see things out tonight
Just remember those who follow close behind when we let ourselves unwind (let ourselves unwind) let ourselves unwind
