You saw me standing there,
Wide awake and ready to let go
You thought reality was,
At your feet but now the world will know
Can't seem to compromise,
The time you've spent has set you far behind
You're lacking judgment now
And I've had enough and now you're out of line
Take my hand,
And never let it go
Running from the truth,
Won't get you very far
The wrong you've done, the price you'll pay
I hope you figure this out someday
So tell me now, I don't know how
To say it any other way
You can't go on
(Knowing this is not the truth)
You can't stay strong
You saw me standing there,
Pacing back and forth without regret
I'm losing sleep tonight,
For all those things I'm trying to forget
My patience running low
It's hard to keep my mind on what I need
I'm getting closer to the,
Things I had intended to receive
I know that, you're sorry,
Just face this, the Hard way
