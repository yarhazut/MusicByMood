Someday, my time will come
You can drag me away from this decay
And I'll follow you
Alone, but not afraid
I'll hide away from every day
Just to see the night
And when the lid is put down tight
I'll drive the nail in one more time
I'll go to any length to say
Someday
And when the world shuts its eyes
Something inside me comes alive
I live to see the look inside your eyes
And when the music starts to play
I'll drift away and escape
I loath the stupid things that you say
Unseen, but not at home
I've seen it all before
And it makes me sick
On time, and right on cue
They'll stand in line for miles
Just to see you smile
And when the evening becomes night
I'll take it all as sacrifice
I'll go to any length to say
Someday
And when the crowd begins to sway
The deadly hunter sees its prey
The feel of fragile souls in my hands
And when the night is complete
The lonely souls begin to weep
The pools of crimson filling in your eyes
Take me away from this decay
