It's in the air
Tonight I feel the end
I've said goodbye
To all my useless friends
In your world
It all seems so sublime
The second hand
Ticks faster every time
And honestly I think you're wrong
I don't need you or anyone
To tell me it's okay
I can feel the storm rush in
And I want to let it all go
Tonight I've lost myself
Float away and lose my hold
It's only a state of mind
Tonight I've found myself
And I'm not asking
You to change your mind
Or hide away
Behind a wall of lies
And I know
Tomorrow will be the same
But to tell the truth
I think I've lost my way
And honestly I don't know why
But it has to be this way
And I don't see the point
Giving in and letting go
I want to disappear
Tonight I've lost myself
Float away and lose my hold
It's only a state of mind
Tonight I've found myself
And honestly I can't complain
Maybe we'd be better gone
Just give it all away
