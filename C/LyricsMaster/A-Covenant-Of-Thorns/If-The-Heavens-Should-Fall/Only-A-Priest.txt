There's no bread
And there's no wine
I'll hear your confession
If you'll hear mine
We live lives
That we make
I'll be your angel
If my wings don't break
Yeah, there's really nothing left to say
'Cause if you don't need me and you don't need me
I'm nothing
Yeah, it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause if you won't see me and you won't see me
I'm nothing
Falling down, out from Heaven
Crawling up, out from Hell
Hold me up, I'm the son of angels
Hold me down, maybe I don't care
Held sacred
Then thrown away
I will bleed for you
As I pray
Dressed in white
And dragged through the mud
I'll be your body
And your blood
