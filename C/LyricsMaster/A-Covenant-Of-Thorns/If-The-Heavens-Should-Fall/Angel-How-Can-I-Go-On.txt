If the rain should come pouring down on me
I don't care
If the stars should dim and fall from the sky
I don't care
You are the missing piece
That makes me whole
You are the missing piece
That completes my soul
Angel, how can I go on
When your always in my head
Angel, how can I go on
When there's so much to be said
If the world should look upon me with evil eyes
I don't care
If the wind should fail to sing me to sleep each night
I don't care
