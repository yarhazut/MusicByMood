I've seen the world end
Time and time again
Stood and watched the walls come down
Watched the cities burned to the ground
And when all is said and done
I know I'm not the only one
Left wanting something else
Wanting something more than this
We can sever all our useless ties
All you have to do is say you'll go
I can see the flames dance in your eyes
We can have it all please don't say no
And when it's ours
We can always ask for more
I'll see the stars
And want to be with them today
I've heard the souls cry out
Through the famines and endless droughts
An empty echo in their eyes
A lonely aching that never dies
And when all is said and done
I know I'm not the only one
Left wanting something else
Wanting something more than this
