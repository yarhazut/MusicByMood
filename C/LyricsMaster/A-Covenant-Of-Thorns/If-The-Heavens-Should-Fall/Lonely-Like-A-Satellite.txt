She sings to the stars
And smiles with her eyes
A fading glimpse
A trick of the light
She floats along
With breathless sighs
A lonely beacon in the night
But to you
She's just another satellite
A distant vision
Whose orbit has decayed
She closes her eyes
And she shuts out the light
She says
Everything looks better that way
Once or twice
Could never make her lose her place
But all her life
Could send her spinning off in space
Some may say
It's not the end
Of the human race
But to her
It feels the same
She floats alone
Across the sun
She drifts from day
Into night
She feels like
She's the only one
But she's one of billions in the night
