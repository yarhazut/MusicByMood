We can't see through your translucent ways
Your words get in our way
Your words get in our way
I don't think I'd want to see anyway
I'd rather be in the dark
I'd rather be in the dark
Drowning in angel's wings
Don't turn away
I swear your halo gives light to my way
And we're so naive
So cynical
We've come undone
And if the heavens should fall
I'll be covered in
A blanket of stars
I'll be the only one
To dance on my own grave
And if the sun goes out
We can dance
Beneath the clouds
The two of us
In a ghostly masquerade
We don't to be told what to say
We speak in our own words
We speak in our own way
And if you took everything I had away
I wouldn't care anyway
I wouldn't care anyway
