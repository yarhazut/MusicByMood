Here I am the one that you adore
You give it all and more
But I'm to wrapped up in myself
Here I am the one you love to hate
Whatever you give I'll take
And push aside what gets in my way
It seems I'm always
Looking in from the outside
I try to keep it straight
But I feel it falling apart
It seems I'm always
Look out from the inside
I try to hold on tight
But I feel it slipping away
Here I am an empty man no pride
Eyes opened wide
Ashamed of the things that I've become
Here I am a shell of a saint that right
I'd try for more but why
I'd just end up with the same mistakes
It seems I'm always
Looking in from the outside
I try to keep it straight
But I feel it falling apart
It seems I'm always
Look out from the inside
I try to hold on tight
But I feel it slipping away
It seems I spend my time
Looking at the wrong side
I see it in my head
And I want to tear it away
It seems there is no way
To get to the upside
I've given what I can
And I feel I'm dragging you down
I am the one that left you there with nothing
I am the one that took it all away
I am the one that left you standing broken
I am the one that stole your dreams away
I am the one that left you feeling empty
I am the one that handed you the blame
I am the one that took it all for granted
I am the one that threw it all way
Things keep getting in the way
It should have been someone else
