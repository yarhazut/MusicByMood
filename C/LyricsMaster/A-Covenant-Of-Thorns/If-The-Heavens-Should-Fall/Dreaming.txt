Oh, I hear you screaming
But I can't hear what you're saying
Drowning in the voices in my head
And I can't feel anything
Sometimes, you pick me up
When I've fallen
But not this way
Sometimes you lift me up
When I'm drowning
But not this way
No, calm down
I think I see you
But then you're fading away
No, calm down
Am I falling
Because I can't see the ground
Oh, I hear you crying
And now you seem so far away
Tears are falling
But don't touch ground
And I
Can't even save myself
No, calm down
I think I see you
But then you're fading away
No, calm down
Am I falling
Because I can't see the ground
No, calm down
I want to touch you
But you won't reach out
No, calm down
Am I dying
Or am I only dreaming
