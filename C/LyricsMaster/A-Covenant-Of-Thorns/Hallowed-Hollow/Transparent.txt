An angel's smile
A devil's soul
I hear your words
But they always sound so hollow
I slip on tears
From things you've said
I block them out
But they're always in my head
I see your face
And I hear your voice
It rings out
But I'm always standing here alone
And I would give anything
To be adored in your eyes
I see right through
Your empty lies
The helplessness
We all hide inside
And I would give anything
To be adored in your eyes
I would give anything
To be adored in God's eyes
