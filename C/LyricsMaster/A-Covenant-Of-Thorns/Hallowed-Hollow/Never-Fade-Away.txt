A crack in the ice
My life's turned upside-down
I sense your warmth in my soul
Love's gentle hand leads me on my way
For the first time in years I don't feel alone
So much I didn't say
I hope you can hear me now
So much I couldn't say until now
The things that I miss
I long to hear you laugh
I never dreamt it would be so hard
Things that you've said
They echo through my head
Like a soothing reminder of who you were
And you have always been the kindest person I've ever known
You stood up for me when no one would
So much I didn't say
I hope you can hear me now
So much I couldn't say until now
The things that I miss
I long for your words of wisdom
I never dreamt it would hurt so much
All this time has made it easier
I hope you know I will always love you
And all this time has made me miss you more
I hope you know you will never fade away
So much I didn't say
I hope you can hear me now
So much I couldn't say until now
The things that I miss
I long for my childhood
I never dreamt it would be so cold
All this time has made it easier
I hope you know I will always love you
And all this time has made me miss you more
I hope you know you will never fade away
You will never fade away
