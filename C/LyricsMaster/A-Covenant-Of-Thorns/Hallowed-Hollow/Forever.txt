In your eyes I can see forever
And it makes me feel so alone
And under your breath I hear you say
There must be something more
And oh, I think there's something more
And oh, I hope there's something more
I hear you scream
Pick me up and take me away
And all around
Are the sounds of fallen hearts
And I hear you whisper
Take me to a better place
And all around
Is the fear that this is it
And I can hear your heart beat
And it sounds so cold
It aches for something more
And oh, I think there's something more
And oh, I hope there's something more
I hear you scream
Pick me up and take me away
And all around
Are the sounds of fallen hearts
And I hear you whisper
Take me to a better place
And all around
Is the fear that this is it
I'm slowing down
I fell your breath on my neck
And all around
Is the sense that something's near
You beg me to stop
I feel your lips pressed to mine
And all around
Is the hope there's nothing more
