I've never seen you look so old
Your limbs are numb and your body's cold
I see your angels smiling down at me
I hear your angels crying out for me
And I want to love, but the feelings stick
And I try to push, but it's never enough
And I want to speak, but the words get stuck
And I try to run, but it's never enough
And I see your smile and it looks like death
Into your eyes all I see is death
And I don't need your angels smiling down at me
And I don't want your angels crying out for me
