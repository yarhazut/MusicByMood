You live alone in your little corner of this lost world
I remember your name though I doubt you remember mine
We watched the sky shed its color from blue to black
I remember the deafening roar of the wind through the trees
Your powdered white face, black lines, sunken eyes
Remind me of the days when we laughed for hours
My hand in yours as the lightning lit an empty sky
My hand in yours
Your powdered white face, black lines, sunken eyes
Remind me of the days when we laughed for hours
My hand in yours as the lightning lit an empty sky
Empty promises, forgotten dreams, and tears
The afternoon shadows stretch through your bedroom windowsill
And down the hall to the room where I sleep each night
Waiting alone in silence for you to return
Waiting alone
The afternoon shadows stretch through your bedroom windowsill
And down the hall to the room where I sleep each night
Waiting alone in silence for you to return
Give me fears, false comfort, and tears
I stand in the corner of your room as you walk away
Down the same hall to the room that was never mine
The tears fall as the roses wilt away
Yeah, wilt away
Oh, with tears
