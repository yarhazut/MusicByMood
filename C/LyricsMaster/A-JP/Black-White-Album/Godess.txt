Legend has it that there's the lady who grants someone's just one wish
Even if it's that you wanna look for "precious thing", "missing thing"
If you really do.
A menial prayed for his wish
He wanna grab back some he left
But he possesses nothing with him, pure heart, even a kindness
"What are you looking for ? Tell me. "
"I can show you anything you want. "
"Why don't you come to me, sweetie pie ? " she said to him
Goddess...
How cruel...
I'm in the everlasting
Can't touch...
Can't feel...
It's just the mirage that I've lost
Things past can't be recalled
With the wisdom of hindsight
What's done can not be done
When you repent, it's too late
"What are you looking for ? Tell me. "
"I can show you anything you want. "
"Why don't you come to me, sweetie pire ? " she said to him
Where am I?
Tell me why?
Fortune smiles for a penitent
Can't awake...
Can't breathe...
What he got is the real he's broken it himself
Goddess...
How cruel...
I'm in the everlasting
Can't touch...
Can't feel...
It's just the mirage
Goddess...
How cruel...
Can't touch...
Can't feel...
It's just the mirage that I've lost
