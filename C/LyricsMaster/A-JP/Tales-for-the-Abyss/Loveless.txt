Fear is over
No one left in this places
Without desire
Echo of my voice in silence
Like army's fire
Conflagrate human races
I can't take cover
Blur my sight, what my life is
The embrace of god in loveless world
How do I get over
Losing the love existence
I'll always suffer
From the inside of my darkness
The embrace of god in loveless world
Embrace of god
Just a fragile we are
Loveless world
Just a fragile we are
Is this love?
The embrace of god in loveless world
The embrace of god in loveless world.
