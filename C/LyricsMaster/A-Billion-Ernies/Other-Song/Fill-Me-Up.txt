Two steps forward
One step back
I'm taking the long road
Walking the path of faith
Never looking back
Whoa
Slowly make marks
Try to keep it straight
I'm taking the long road
Staying of the plank
Never looking back
Whoa
Well I will keep on walking
Till my legs are gonna break
Well I will keep on walking
Fill me up
Fill me up to the tip top
With your love
Fill me up
Fill me up to the tip top
With your love
Fill me up
Fill me up to the tip top
With your love
Fill me up
Fill me up to the tip top
With your love
Fill me
Fill me up with you
So I can fall in love with you
O fill me
Fill me up with you
So I can fall in love
Fill me
Fill me up with you
So I can fall in love with you
O fill me
Fill me up with you
So I can fall in love with you
O fill me
Fill me up with you
So I can fall in love with you
O fill me
Fill me up with you
So I can fall in love with you
Fill me up with you
Fill me
Fill me up with you
Fill me
Fill me up with you
Fill me
Fill me up with you
