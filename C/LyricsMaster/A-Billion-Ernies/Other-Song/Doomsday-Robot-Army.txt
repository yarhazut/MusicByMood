Over the hills the doomsday robot army marches on becoming from the sea they're metal and they're strong hark the people in the village flee for the hills terror consumes and down their backs run the chills pay the bills the robots got skills
The time has come doomsday has begun wake up your children from their beds run and hide or they'll melt your heads
I take refuge in some foliage where I'm safe from their lasers I shield my eyes and estimate their growing numbers a million nay a billion nay at least a billion million of them coming for me you your mouse dog and that man me the heat seeking missiles will explode your head
Do not lose hope one day we'll find the crank and we'll have a hero his name will be skankin' hank.
