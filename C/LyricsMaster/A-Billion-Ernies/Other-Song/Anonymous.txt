Where's the line between
Genious and stupidity
What's the difference
Between profound and offensive?
You sing about my empty faith
While you call me closed-minded
I don't even know your name.
And you pretend you're the enlightened one
I have nothing to say to you,
But you think you have one
When I have nothing to prove to you.
Hide behind your dots,
Your asterisk, your anonymous.
I know more about you
Than you think that you know about me.
You are a dime a dozen.
You are nothing special.
Slap us in the face,
Turn your back and run.
Go and hide before you are proved wrong.
Christ is the reason we write these songs.
There is nothing you can do about it.
All the world will hold this song as proof
That you have made impact on me
But you just wait and see
I will stick with my God forever.
