When there's no one there to talk to
No one to be your friend
Turn your eyes upon Jesus
Just throw him a line
It doesn't matter when
He loves it when you pray
He loves the things you say
Step up to the microphone
Say what you have to say
Another poor man crying asking God for help
Again you don't see him crying anymore
He trusted God all the way to the end
Put your life with God completely
So when you die you have a home
This life down here is nothing
You get to choose your fate for eternity
On one hand you have the Devil
Clever as can be
He'll pull you down
He'll throw you around
And when he's done with you, you're as dead as can be
Another poor man crying asking God for help
Again you don't see him crying anymore
He trusted God all the way to the end
Trust me choose the high road
You can live in peace for eternity
You won't be crying anymore
When I look to heaven
It brings out the best in me
If you want what I have
Follow me
So in the end when you have nothing
No place to call your home
Will you then ask God for something
It's time to choose your fate, fire or gold
Another poor man crying asking God for help
Again you don't see him crying anymore
He trusted God all the way to the end
Trust me choose the high road
You can live in peace for eternity
You won't be crying anymore
When I look to heaven
It brings out the best in me
If you want what I have
Follow
Follow me
