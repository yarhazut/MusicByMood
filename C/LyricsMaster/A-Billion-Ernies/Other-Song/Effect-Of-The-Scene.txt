Effect of The Scene
She puts on a shirt.
It acts like camouflage,
Protecting her from staring eyes and cold remarks
Just fit in and no one will notice.
Just pretend you get along with them
They will fake it right back
No need to break the mold
No need to break it.
So hop right on.
The more the merrier
It's a pity party and everyone's invited.
Just play their games
Shell fit right in
And watch as all her friends follow the same path she is
Watch as they all forget their God, and fall away
She thought she caught the ride
To happiness and love,
But this ride leads to nothing but a lie.
A place where nobody cares at all,
And it's a shame
Sometimes she won't go home.
She's too scared to be alone,
And she falls apart when no one's there.
But God had never left her side.
He wants to tell her she's all right,
But she doesn't listen anymore.
She can't trust herself
So she listens to others like her.
One day they will betray her trust.
And she will forgive them
