I stepped out of my house for the first time in my life
I'm feelin' pretty good got on my best suit and tie
I'm riding in a car that I've never been in before
It is black and it's followed by a few more
We start to slow down to make a quick stop
Someone opens the back and takes out a box
Standing around a hole with flowers and a tree
I look at the headstone to see it's me
I'm gonna be late to the show time to go
For the life of me I can't express how much I want for you to see
But my tongue holds back
I just want you to know the ending is worth the wait
I know the plot is slow but this secret must be kept
I start to walk away then a man calls out for me
Over here my friend now it's time to leave
He pat's me on the back said the movie will be great
A stroke of genius that will make you
Realize that all that you lived for is right
But one thing he said there's one simple rule
For the life of me I can't express how much I want for you to see
But my tongue holds back
I just want you to know the ending is worth the wait
I know the plot is slow but this secret must be kept
Slowly the destination comes into view
The lights are blinding so I shield my eyes
The closer I get the warmer I feel
This kind of warmth that makes your soul heal
I pull out my wallet to pay at the door
The man behind the window, he tells me, he tells me it's all paid for
He hands me the ticket and we head inside
The free ticket seemed strange so I asked my man why
He told me I'd lived a good life and my questions will all be aswered soon
So here's some popcorn your movie is in that room
For the life of me I can't express how much I want for you to see
But my tongue holds back
I just want you to know the ending is worth the wait
I know the plot is slow but this secret must be kept
Please do not reveal the ending
