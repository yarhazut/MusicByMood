All for the money
Did you see him jump right off the speaker last night?
I think Ill do that, at our next show
I wanna be just like the guys I saw on TV
I wanna play the Roxy so bad, I can almost taste it
Don't you know if you don't, then you won't get signed
I am so sick of being stepped on
I will scream, then sing on the chords,
'Cause that's what's cool today
It's not a matter of whether I like it or not (chorus)
Maybe I should do my hair just like Robert Smith
Maybe we can all dress up in suits,
Just like The Beatles
So sick of playing small-time shows
In small own, with small amps
Pay the promoters, and you just might play
At your favorite venue
Don't you know if you don't then you won't get signed
Is nothing sacred?
Not since checked, because
