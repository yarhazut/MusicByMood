This is torture
At it's finest state
My blankets are warm 
And there's too much on my plate 
I feel happy
I feel dull 
The fireplace is glowing 
My wineglass is always full
Fix your hair 
I think I will sleep under the stars tonight 
I've got everything I need
Right here
Take a walk take a trip take a stand
With me the air's much better 
When you can breathe 
The sky's more blue when you can see 
I feel happy 
I feel content lying on a rock 
Sleeping in a tent 
One thing I regret is not bringing me TV set 
Not to watch or admire 
But to throw in my dying fire 
I think this spot will do 
This is omnipresence in its priest form I've got everything I need right here
This is omnipresence in its priest form 
I've got everything I need right here
I thought I had it all
