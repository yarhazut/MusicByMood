Yeah yeah yeah
The midnight sky is black and blue
The galaxy surrounds me
You let me in, you get me high
The world revolves around me
Beneath my skin, deep down inside
I wear you like a tattoo
I taste your bread, I drink your wine
You're like the god, I need you
Take me to the river and make me holy
Teach me, show me
I feel your touch, you take my breath
You make it feel like heaven
You used to say I was the devil
Now you're trying to change me
You call my name in hopes that you could save me
You gave me life when I saw death
It was staring at me
And make me holy
Teach me, show me
Make me holy
Teach me, show me
I don't wanna meet your maker
I don't wanna meet your maker
I don't wanna meet your maker
I don't wanna meet your maker
Take me to the river
Make me better, wash my sins away
And make me holy
Teach me, show me
Make me holy
Teach me, show me
