For reasons that I don't understand
I was out with a shovel in my hand
If someone's seen me, let me know
I must've been looking for sand or snow
I had a garden on my mind
Ivy was growing around my spine
I lost a needle in the hay
I'm hoping I'll never need it anyway
I wanted to plant a little seed
To fertilize the dirt
I didn't see the sleeping weed
The weed had got there first
