Brighten the corners and clear out the room
Color the flowers in rose and maroon
Light up the fires and season this wine
We're gonna party like it's 1699
Slaughter the rabbits,
The doves and the boars
And lay all the tables and open the doors
The Creme del a Creme will be waiting
On one guest of honor
Oh up go the curtains
And down go the virgins 
Oh no, mothers are crying 
Ladies of virtue, will stand to accuse you of heartbreak and theft 
 
Bells are gonna ring
Birds are gonna sing
Let the people begin
The crowning of your big head
Young drunken girls in a hideous dance
Sing a heartfelt lament
Of the death of romance
Beautiful boys turn and offer their cheeks
Preening and prancing,
The outcome looks bleak  
Good times are rolling
But outside these walls
Our houses will crumble, this city will fall
But a few broken pawns don't mean nothing
To our guest of honor 
So let's raise our glasses
To murderess asses like you
May you sleep soundly
Once we had laughter,
You got what you're after 
Oh you wear it well 
Bells are gonna ring
Birds are gonna sing
Let the people begin
Hear how the hearts are pounding
We're all witnessing the crowning
Of your big bleeding head
Bells are gonna ring
Birds ar gonna sing
Let the people begin
Hear how the hearts are pounding
Your rise, nothing but astounding
We're all witnessing the crowning
On your useless, ruthless head
