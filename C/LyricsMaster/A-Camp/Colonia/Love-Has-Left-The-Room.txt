Love has left the room
The party is over
But I can't get sober
Obsession is towing me
Deep down down
Love has left the room
It fled out the back door
When all I asked for
Was forever more
Or a real bye bye
It didn't say bye bye
And I'll let go if you just tell me
Give back the pieces of dreams
That you sell me
They trick my mind
I'll let go if you just tell me
I will forget you
If you will forget me
I'll slip your mind
I will slip your mind
Tie me to the mast
Cast me in irons
I hear the sirens
They sing of desire
The fatal kind
This love is my last
My final possession
Most violent caress
It's a beautiful mess
And it's deep down down
It's really deep down down
And I'll let go if you just tell me
Give back the pieces of dreams
That you sell me
They trick my mind
I'll let go if you just let me
I will forget you
If you will forget me
I'll slip your mind
I will slip your mind
Once it settles down
And the fire has burned out
What d'you think you'll find
Poking through the embers
Memories that sting
Little splinters of your doubt
Things that you can live without
So why die?
Give back the pieces of dreams
That you sell me
And trick my mind
I'll let go if you just let me
I will forget you
If you will forget me
I'll slip your mind
I will slip your mind
