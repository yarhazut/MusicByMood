Don't send me letters in bottles anymore
And don't come a-knocking or darken my door
We've got a contract, devotion evermore
We're legally bonded in richness and in poor
I signed the line that was dotted
I like to end what I started
I signed the line
And I realise a lot of lies
Were written in letter and bottles they tend to run aground
Don't give me platinum to weigh down my wrist
I've got injunctions, so cease and desist
I've got a bottle, a ball and a chain
But you have the one thing of value that remains
I signed the line that was dotted
I like to end what I started
There's too much I need, I gotta plead insanity
So don't give me platinum, it just weighs me down
I signed the line
I realise a lot of lies
Were written in letters
And bottles they tend to run aground
