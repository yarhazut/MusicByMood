Who told you love is the Alpha and Omega? 
And that your heart will lead you to the only one? 
It's a curse, it's the hammer that will break you, 
It's a poison hidden in a bon bon 
Don't you know love is stronger than Jesus? 
Don't you know love can kill anyone? 
Bring it on; wars and diseases 
You know that love can do you like a shotgun 
Can't resist them, the sailors and the soldiers 
Taking aim, a rabbit on a rifle range 
Pay no mind to what your mama told you 
You're the fool who's chasing down the candy cane 
It's a riddle how lovers can stay alive 
But we bloom and breathe in all decline 
Don't you know love is stronger than Jesus? 
Don't you know love can kill anyone? 
So bring it on; wars and diseases 
You know that love can do you like a shotgun 
O, oh no 
O, oh no 
See the people heading for disaster 
Standing in line just looking for a little fun 
Love is a fire, a hot hot blaster 
And we're the Belgians burning in the Congo sun
We'll believe there's trust in strangers 
Any monkey looking like a savior 
It's a riddle how 
We're still living now 
Oh, how little we know, oh 
Don't you know love is stronger than Jesus? 
Don't you know love can kill anyone? 
So bring it on; wars and diseases 
You know that love can do you like a shotgun
