The route of our journey is traced out in pink
A map of the continents waiting to sink
We're an army in training, me and my band
Making camp in the evenings, grazing the land
We're never alone here
There is lots of unknown here in the brush
Here are many wild animals
Shipped off to a city, stripped of our tongues
Now we live in a playground, eating our young
We're never alone here, no
There's lots of unknown here in the crowd
Here are many wild animals
Ooh - they're dropping the bomb
Like in the beginning, the number is three
It's a small party of roaches, scorpions and me - oh
Forever alone here
There's lots of unknown here in the glow
Here are many wild animals
Come little kitty, come little elephant
Come come hither, be with your mama
Come little bastard, come little millionaire
Come, come faster, this is America
Come little rodent, come little carnivore
Eat your dinner
