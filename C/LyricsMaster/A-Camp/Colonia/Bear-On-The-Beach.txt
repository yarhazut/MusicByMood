Iris in the morning rain, sitting in a sea
It's hard to tell the blues apart,
She's salty just like me
She thinks we're on an island
Or she wishes that she were
She thinks she hears the sirens
But I think it's okay
Iris in the morning rain sitting in a sea
She didn't wanna see
The fruit was out of reach
She's caught between the ocean
And the bear upon the beach
Imaginary waves could never drown you
And I didn't want to tell her
I didn't want to tell her
Iris on a ladder, climbing closer to the sky
Rising from the grind,
She is a quitter just like I
Sitting on a rooftop,
Watching molecules collide
Safe above it all,
She's drinking mercury on ice
Iris on a ladder climbing closer to the sky
She didn't wanna see
The stars were out of reach
She's caught between the ocean
And the bear upon the beach
Imaginary gods could never save you
And I didn't want to tell her
Didn't want to tell her
She didn't wanna see
The stars were out of reach
She's caught between the ocean
And the bear upon the beach
Imaginary gods could never save you
But I didn't want to tell her
I didn't want to tell her
