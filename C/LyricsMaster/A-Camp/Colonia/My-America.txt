Darling, darling
The moon went out tonight
And I'm caught like a doe in your headlights
Oh yeah, all right
I'm yours to knock around
I'm a little too starstruck to wanna fight
Ooh-e-ooh-ee, it's a cold-hearted world
Ooh-e-ooh-ee-ooh, I'm gonna be your girl
It's a little too late to cry
You're my America
Not quite snow white
It came down all night
And put a filter of ash on the sunrise
Oh yeah, all right
Move a little bit closer
Lay your big dirty hands on my innocence
Ooh-e-ooh-ee, it's a cold-hearted world
Ooh-e-ooh-ee-ooh, I'm gonna be your girl
It's just a little too late to cry
You're my America
Ooh, heaven laughs at us now, baby
But we'll be shooting it down, honey
It's a little too late to hope and pray for a miracle
You're my America
Hey Rock star!
You're my America
