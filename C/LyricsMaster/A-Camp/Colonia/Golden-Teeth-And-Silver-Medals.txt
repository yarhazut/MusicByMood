Anybody tell you
That there is no resale value
When your romance goes to hell you
Better say farewell to what
You thought was wealth
Ever get the feeling
That the paint has started peeling
Are you staring at the
Ceiling of your castle
Dreaming that you're
Someone else
Would you like to meet me in this song?
(I've been hoping to)
Would you like to come
And prove me wrong?
(No, I'll agree with you)
Golden teeth and silver medals
Beauty marks and scars
That is what we got
Raindrops in a reservoir
And minutes in a jar
That is what we got
Maybe if I had another drink
I'd see the pattern in the blinking
Of the traffic lights
Do you think you're happy, Nicolai?
I don't know the answer Nina
Life is like a melody
A pendulum that swings
Between the major and the minor
It's a lullaby
I'm so glad I met you in this song
(It's just a breath I'll throw)
I'm so glad you're here to sing along
(My voice into the flow)
Golden teeth and silver medals
Beauty marks and scars
That is what we got
Raindrops in a reservoir
And minutes in a jar
That is what we got
I'm a little worried that the worst is yet to come
I'm afraid they'll leave us out here
Melting in the sun
We'll be second best until
We know we have won
But until we do we'll sing this song
(Till we know we've won)
We'll sing until our need for it is gone
(We'll be singing this song)
Golden teeth and silver medals
Beauty marks and scars
That is what we got
Raindrops in a reservoir
And minutes in a jar
That is what we got
