I met a boy called Charlie Charlie
On the 4th of September last year
He was 21 and once a teenage star
So sweet in the way he appeared
In the way he appeared
Charlie Charlie
He was a trip into
The wild and the free
Got high on drinks and me
In rock'n roll dreams
We share the days and nights
Till one morning
He showed me
I fell in love with Charlie Charlie
It felt like the right thing to do
With his careless, charmed
And his jaded eyes
I know you would have fall in, too
You would have fall in, too
Charlie Charlie
He was a trip into
The wild and the free
Got high on drinks and me
In rock'n roll dreams
We share the days and nights
Till one morning
He showed me
Charlie Charlie
When for I'm and
At the end of the street
They stole my heart
But if you happen to meet
You tell him I don't want
The morning that he owes me
I just wanna know
What went through him
'Cause I could never know
He don't know
I thought I knew him
Charlie Charlie
What are you doing to me
Charlie Charlie
He's got my credit card
And has something seen
He stole my heart
But if you happen to meet
Can tell him I don't want the morning
Though I just want you
