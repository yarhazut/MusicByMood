Sorry Angel, sorry so
I committed you to suicide, lover
But was it worth the pain?
You drew to a close, for me, not another
Painted red in vain
Sorry Angel, sorry so
The countdown started on a four-knuckled hand
One way scalping sold out dreams
You bought it and bled in a broken promised land
You kept your word hid to all but me
Sorry Angel, sorry so
I tried to talk you out of it, lover
But your mind was setting sun
A red-head horizon wearing my colours
I miss that painted leather zipped undone
Sorry Angel, sorry so
I committed you to suicide, lover
It was me who held the knife you fell on
It's as if I'd pulled the rope tighter
Now you're not here, I am
Sorry Angel, sorry so
