Daddy's gone
Daddy's gone to go to work today
To make a little money
He gotta get paid
Bake a cake
Bake a cake and set it on the plate
Up high where the dogs can't get it
So it don't get ate
When you lay your head
On your pillow, I'll be gone
I'll be gone
Will you breathe your dreams
To your pillow like a song
I woke up and all my yesterdays were gone
Close your eyes
Close your eyes until your dreams arrive
I keep 'em tied where the hounds can't get em
So they don't get ate
When you raise your head
From your pillow don't delay
'Cause people decay
When we let they rays
Of the sun help you along
I woke up and all my yesterdays were gone
I woke up and all my yesterdays were gone
I woke up and all my yesterdays were gone
I woke up and all my yesterdays were gone
