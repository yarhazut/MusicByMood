Quack goes the goose
And also goes the duck
Moo goes the cow
My dad is a business man
He likes to drink a few
He likes to watch the footy
And doesn't flush his poo
When hes not at works hes dirty
Digging in his pit
When its deep enough
He hangs a little shit
Woo my dad is weird
Yeah he is very strange
He makes all his chickens
Lay all their eggs free range
My dad bets on the footy
And although he always loses
He sits in his chair
Pulling out his hair
And calls everyone losers
