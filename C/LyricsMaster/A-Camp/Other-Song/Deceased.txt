I'm not here to harm you
So let me disarm you, you'll see what I mean
I'm yours for you already know me
Stay with me and show me the way to my dreams
Together we can live a life we know is real
We move silently through my room and make me feel
That love can be a place we never have to leave
Be strong, stay with me, never disappear
Deep in my heart I see clearly
We should be revealing our secrets today
Please, don't just stay there, I'm waiting
For the plans you've been making to take me away
Together we can live a life we know is real
We move silently through my room and make me feel
That love can be a place we never have to leave
Be strong, stay with me, never disappear
Together we can live a life we know is real
We move silently through my room and make me feel
That love can be a place we never have to leave
Be strong, stay with me, never disappear
Together we can live a life we know is real
We move silently through my room and make me feel
That love can be a place we never have to leave
Be strong, stay with me, never disappear
