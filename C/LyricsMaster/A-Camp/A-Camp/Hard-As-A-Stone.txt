In the morning and in the evening
When you think you're alone
Too many hours in your apartment
Has made me hard a stone
I tried to crack you
I told you you're the one
But you must have though that I was gone
I told you a lot of lies just to get laid
But your heart is hard as a stone
You're a vicious but I'm a man
I'm gonna do what I can to remain hard as a stone
That little pigeon where did you find it?
I had to break her every bone
Eleven hours in your pool
No wonder I'm hard as a stone
She was delicious now I'm a star
If you wanna be what you are you better be hard as a stone
(The chorus)
You're mean, but I'm a man
It's not exactly what I planned but it seems I'm hard as a stone
Hard as a stone
