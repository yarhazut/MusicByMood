The lonesome Texas sun was setting low
And in the rearview-mirror I watched it go
I can still see the wind in her golden hair
I close my eyes - for a moment I'm still there
The bluest eyes in Texas are haunting me tonight
Like the stars that fill the midnight sky, her memory fills my mind
Where did I go wrong? Did I wait too long? Or can I make it right?
The bluest eyes in Texas are haunting me tonight
Another town, another hotel room
Another dream that ended way too soon
Left me lonely way before the dawn
Searching for the strength to carry on
The bluest eyes in Texas are haunting me tonight
Like the stars that fill the midnight sky, her memory fills my mind
Where did I go wrong? Did I wait too long? Or can I make it right?
The bluest eyes in Texas are haunting me tonight
For every heart you break
You pay the price
But I can't forget the tears
In her blue eyes
The bluest eyes in Texas are haunting me tonight
Like the stars that fill the midnight sky, her memory fills my mind
Where did I go wrong? Did I wait too long? Or can I make it right?
The bluest eyes in Texas are haunting me tonight
The bluest eyes in Texas are haunting me tonight
The bluest eyes, the bluest eyes
Are haunting me
The bluest eyes... Tonight
