Something's waching over me
There's someone in my house that I can't see
I've asked her many times to leave
She tells me she's not evil
In my hours of confidence
When feeling real and worthy of my friends
When I let go of my defence
She's waiting in a corner
Angel Of Sadness
Leave Me Alone
Save Me Some Hours
To Try On My Own
When The Music Is Over
The Silence Is On
You Know I Will Be Yours Alone
So Pick Me Up And Carry Me On
Life with her is getting hard
It's like I'm not the driver of my own car
I'm not the holder of my credit car
Oh Jesus, make me sober
Misery comes and lovers go
I lose myself and sometimes I don't know
She says "I've always told you so
But I'll stay with you forever"
Angel Of Sadness...
Angel Of Sadness
Angel Of Grief
Save Me Some Hours
To Try On My Own
When The Music Is Over
The Silence Is On
I'll Be Completely On My Own
But I'll Work It Out
And Find Me A Home
