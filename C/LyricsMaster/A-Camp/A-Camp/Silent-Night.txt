Baby brown, I think I need you now
To put me down and help me lift me up
Your shaking bones in my telephone
No good for anyone
Baby brown, so you think you know me now?
You tell me how and show me everything
Your wandering mind and your restless kind
I want you here to make some sound
Oh, silent night
Oh, holy night
Baby brown, now you're more than you mean to be
You're mean to me, you take away from me
My shaking bones in your telephone
Don't you hear that sound?
Oh, silent night
Oh, holy night
Oh, silent night
Oh, there's a hole in the night
Oh, silent night
Oh, holy night
Oh, silent night
Oh, there's a hole in the night
