I caught you smiling with pointed teeth
What once was beautiful has turned bitter and cheap
So now there's nothing I can do for you
But leave your roses out to die
I misbehaved
I'm in your way
I'm in your way
Like an elephant
Gentle smiling with pointed teeth
Now there's a war between my high hopes and me
So this is how you put an end to things?
By cutting throats with a smile?
I misbehaved
I'm in your way
In your way
Like an elephant
But in the corner of my mind
A little angel saying
Don't waste your love
You love too much
