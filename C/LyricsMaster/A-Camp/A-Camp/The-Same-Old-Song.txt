Here's my prayer, I'm getting nowhere
I'm stepping up the stairs, but falling behind, oh...
I'm a one-man show that nobody knows
My body sure knows, I'm wondering why, oh...
I can't go on singing this song
That the angels will not hear
The world is a hole from all that I stole
But there is still a little love in here
Few things will last
I did it too fast, but I'm learning to cry
Don't be a stepping stone
Get it all out, deliver it
Here's my weep, I'm digging too deep
I do believe in lies, I've got everything to hide, oh...
I'm young, I'm old, I do what I'm told
Cut open, unfold, but there's nothing inside, oh...
I can't go on singing this song
That the angels will not hear
The world is a hole from all that I stole
But there is still a little love in here
Few things will last
I did it too fast, but I'm learning to cry
Hey child, you dance too loud
Here is your limit
No, I can't go on singing this song
That the angels will not hear
The world is a hole from all that I stole
But there is so much love in here
Few things will last
I did it too fast, but I'm learning to cry
Don't be a stepping stone
Get it all out, deliver it
Here's my plead, my never-ending repeat
I'm a circular cry-baby with no-one to trust
I'm restless and mad and anciently sad
If someone wants to kill me, go ahead, but make it fast
