A life of sanity and dignity
You know it takes two
And what's the use in being a millionaire
If I can't have you
I wanna buy you a home
I'll pay your friends if you're feeling alone
The pain of losing a guy like you
Is a bigger cost than paying your dues
I can buy you, oh yeah, oh yeah
But I can't make you do what you don't
And I can hire you, oh yeah, oh yeah
But I can't make you love me, I can't make you
You say I'd never go for a little
And I always need more
And you're a thousand-dollar playboy
That I just can't afford
But I guess you got me, oh oh
You got me hanging around for too long
I don't wanna stop it, oh no, oh no
I bet your life that it's with me you belong
And I can buy you, oh yeah, oh yeah
But I can't make you do what you don't
And I can hire you, oh yeah, oh yeah
But I can't make you love me, I can't make you care
So if I can't make you love me
If I can't make you care
What price can take me there in this world
Somebody told me cash is care
I didn't mean to force you, oh no
But I bet a fortune it's with me you belong
And I can buy you, oh yeah, oh yeah
But I can't make you do what you don't
And I can hire you, oh yeah, oh yeah
But I can't make you love me, I can't make you care
I can't take you there anymore...
