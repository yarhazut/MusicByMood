Would you help me pack my bags, I might be leaving
I need some sweet assistance while I'm stealing
Some of your time
I hope that's fine
And I've got photographs of all, you're all I'm needing
Forgiveness if I left you all believing
That I'm the one 'cause I feel like none
And I need something to direct me to it
'Cause I'm a frequent flyer, a notorious liar
But I can't get close enough
I never get close
I can't get close enough
I would love to tell my story from the ending
But the story's getting thin from heavy spending
And I need my man, and I need a fence
And I need someone to protect me from the wrench
I'm a frequent flyer, a notorious liar
But I can't get close enough
I never get close
I can't get close enough to the ending
I can't get close enough
I can't get close enough
To the sun
I can't get close enough
I'm a frequent flyer, a notorious liar
But I can't get close enough
I never get close
I can't get close enough... it seems
