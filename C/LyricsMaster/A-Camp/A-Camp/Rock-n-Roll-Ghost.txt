Well, you know and you go
When I'm alone I have no cause
To think about the shit we used to know
Made of snow
Well you came, and you stayed
No-one here to raise a toast
Be my guest and I will be your host
To a rock 'n' roll ghost
A rock 'n' roll ghost
Well, you said she's better off dead
You think that I might have heard a word
But I was much too young, and much too cool for words
Look at me now
No-one here to raise a toast
Take me by the hand, man... Raise a toast
Or the rock 'n' roll ghost
To a rock 'n' roll ghost
We don't know until we're gone
There's no one here to raise a toast
I look into the mirror and I see
The rock 'n' roll ghost
My rock 'n' roll ghost
