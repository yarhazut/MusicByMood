Come on baby sing
Of the oddness
Of the lord
It's about time we sang
Of the strange ways
Of the lord
The oddness of the lord
The oddness of the lord
Come on baby sing
Of the oddness
Of the lord
The strange ways
Of the lord
The sacred
And the cursed
It's never
Getting better
No no no
It's only
Getting worse
Come on people sing
Of the oddness
Of the lord
Everybody sing
Of the strange ways
Of the lord
The oddness of the lord
The sacred
And the cursed
It's never
Getting better
No no no
It's only
Getting worse
It's never
Getting better
No no no
NO NO
Ow ow ow.
