I danced for a while
And my moves
Would make you smile
Oh, I loved you then
My dear chemical lover
You veiled me in your haze
Like a puppet in your lace
Amazing disgrace
From your
Silverspoon substance
You took me away
Made Monday a Saturday
You stained me with love
And left me in dirty laundry
But I left my ground
For a minute
Your body in my veins
Your power is what remains
You know I never had
Such a bad
Bad comedown
You took me away
Made Monday a Saturday
You stained me with love
And left me in dirty laundry
But I left my ground
For a minute
My oh my
You took pride
In my fuck-up
I've been cursed
And I've been hailed
I have blown it
And I've inhaled
But I never had
Such a bad
Bad comedown
Such a bad
Bad comedown
Such a bad
Bad comedown
