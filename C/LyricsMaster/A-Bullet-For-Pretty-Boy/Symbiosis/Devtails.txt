This is a nightmare
And we're the ones to blame
We're the ones who need to
Make things change
Lead by example
You've heard it too many times before
Well what's stopping it from
Sinking in
I followed man's footsteps
And now look where I'm at
Stuck in a chamber of sadness and regret
Even I didn't know what to expect
What would happen
How things change
Everywhere I look
Something is blurred
Influenced turned to impurity
Happiness turned to perversion
And only God knows how long this will last
I've changed and contorted
My identity
The secrets I hold are finding the light
Slowly dragging me down
It's like I'm standing in a pit of quicksand
What's been twisted
Can't be perfectly straight again
By God, I'll do my best
So I'm taking what's on the inside
And throwing it all away
Hoping for some comfort
This is a nightmare
Make things change
Lead by example
You've heard it too many times before
Well what's stopping it from
Sinking in?
I want to be the light in the dark
Not the weight that pulls you down
