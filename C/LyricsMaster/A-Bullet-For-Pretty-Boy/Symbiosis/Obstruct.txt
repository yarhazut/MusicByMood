I've taken off my cloak
I've removed this sin from my heart
From my soul from my mind
Where have I gone wrong?
What is the next stop?
I've removed this sin from my heart and mind
I cannot hear you
I can't hear you
I don't feel you near
It's like my eyes have been sewn shut
As if my ears have been covered with the devil's hands
It's clear I've lost control
It's clear I've slipped away
I need your light to show me the way
This is just a lack of communication
I need your light to show me the way
I need to be free of this
I need to be free of the shackles I'm in
What is my last resort
To rip my way out?
I need your light to show me the way
