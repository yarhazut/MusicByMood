We're all just sinking ships
We never asked to be this way
But we bring it on ourselves
God's not the one to blame
The devil has our hand and knows how to work
We calmly gave it to him
Simply placed it in his hand
You noticed way too late
You're falling further away
Surrounded by walls of misery
It's time to climb your way out
If you try it alone
You'll dig yourself deeper
Hold on tight
I want to do right by you
You need all the help you can get
Live your life
But don't drag us down with you
You need all the help you can get
Live your life
But don't drag us down with you
You need all the help you can get
Through all the pain you brought
Through all the negative things you've sent my way
I still feel the same
It's time to face your problems like a man
Stop running
Stop running from them and pushing them aside
They'll come to haunt you sooner than you think
Hold on tight
I want to do right by you
You need all the help you can get
Live your life
But don't drag us down with you
You need all the help you can get
Grab the rope that's been thrown to you
You need all the help you can get
Embrace the hope that's been poured on you
This could be the last chance you get
I want to do right by you
But don't drag us down with you
Reach out
