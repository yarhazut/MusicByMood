The emotions that keep me down
The feelings that hold me back
When time isn't on my side
What's next?
Another disappointment used for distraction?
These past years have been a mirage
Something to keep me from the truth
I've put my focus on so many things
That don't even matter
If I could throw them in a box and burn it
Would I do it?
Bury what has been disintegrated
If I could throw it in the ocean
Would it sink or be a constant reminder?
I'm asking familiar questions
And repeating the same lines
Unsure of what I'm saying
But faith couldn't come at a better time
One of the few things I have not lost
'Cause without faith
What leg would I stand on?
The emotions that keep me down
The feelings that hold me back
When time isn't on my side
What's next?
With all of life's obstacles
What's the next path hold?
Unsure of what I'm saying
But faith could not have come at a better time
One of the few things I have not lost
'Cause without faith
What leg would I stand on?
