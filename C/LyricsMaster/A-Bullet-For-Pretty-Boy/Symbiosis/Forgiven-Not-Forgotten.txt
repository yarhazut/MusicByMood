Why am I still around?
Why do I even bother?
You caused this darkness in my heart
You created the bitterness of my soul
So what's enough or is it just too late
He gave you breath of life
But why, no one knows
One last try or should I see myself out?
That's what the others have done
Everyone has turned their back to you
You asked for this
You've run away with your tail between your legs
You're reaping what you've sown
There is a connection that can't be broken
As much as I want to let go
I'd love to see you come to the other side
Cross this river and be welcomed
You are forgiven
He gave you breath of life
But why, no one knows
One last try or should I see myself out?
Is it just to be an example for what not to do?
I refuse to believe it
I say it's time for a change
Pray for another direction
