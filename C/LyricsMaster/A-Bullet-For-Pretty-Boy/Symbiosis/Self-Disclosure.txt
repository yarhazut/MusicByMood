Shelter me Oh Lord
I haven't let go
It's times like these that I seem to
Reach out
You are the guide
I've been asking for
You are the God
I've been searching for
So I've opened my arms
To feel your embrace
I have no doubt
You can change my life
Dig to the deepest darkest part of me
And pull out the filth
Make me whole
I want to be one with You
Let me be one with You
Take away my clothes of mourning
And clothe me with your joy
I'm not worthy
Yet you can do it anyway
Get in my face God
I want to lock eyes
With the eyes of fire
You are the God
I've been searching for
So I've opened my arms
To feel your embrace
I have no doubt
You can change my life
Dig to the deepest darkest part of me
