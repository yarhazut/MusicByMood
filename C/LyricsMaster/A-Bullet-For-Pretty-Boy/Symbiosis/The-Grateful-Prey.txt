The threats we receive
The torment we endure
The demons that remain steady and resilient
They're the shadows that followed me
Mocking my every move
I'm not the only one
No one can hide
They hunt us down and tear us apart
Without a care in the world
From strength to fear in a single breath
Within seconds we can feel powerless
You who were once a part of me
I promise you
I will never see that face again
Unable to move
But able to pray
Hopeful and wishing I gave it a try
I took a leap of faith
To make it all disappear
To make it all vanish
The evil that was around me
Took hold and stared me in the face
Sinking in deep
Luckily I was scared into something
I don't believe in
This unseen realm
Came to pay me a visit
Unable to move
But able to pray
Hopeful and wishing I gave it a try
You who were once a part of me
I promise you
I will never see that face again
