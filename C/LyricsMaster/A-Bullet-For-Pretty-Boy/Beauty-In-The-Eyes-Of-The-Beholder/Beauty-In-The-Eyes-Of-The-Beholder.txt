Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God where do I run?
Your message holds true though we fall short
We're all trying to let ourselves know the secrets, they give us the hope
We've recognized and realized these voices will tell us where to go
Bring your love down Father, I'm giving You my shield and my sword
So that You can guide me
Too many times I've tried
But the ever so inviting say
Take a hold of me
Not now, not tonight
Ask me please, these questions that I answer desperately, 
In search of something more
The memories of my past I can't seem to overcome, to overcome
But millions upon millions seem to forget, Your love is real
Not the ways of the world
Your love is so real
Your love is so real
And I will open my ears, and I will open my heart
Just to hear what You want me to hear [2x]
And incline Your ear to my ear [4x]
OH GOD, we were wrong [4x]
Incline Your ear to my ear
