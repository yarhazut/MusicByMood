Man can not stand up to the beast,
Can't stand without you.
It's getting darker, these days are longer,
With my face on the floor.
When they're beside me, what is left?
The late nights of darkness grow in number.
When they're beside me, what is left?
The late nights of darkness grow in number.
God, oh god, raise my strength and help me be tolerant.
Lay these scars on my heart, my days wait for this... No tomorrow.
You will never hurt me, but you will make me bleed,
And this will be my last wish before I pass away.
Before I pass away...
I'm falling faster than my selfish ways can repair.
I'm falling faster than my selfish ways...
I'm falling faster than my selfish ways can repair.
This is my secret, this is my cry...
This is my secret, this is my cry for help.
He warned me, I'd choose to fall.
He warned me, I'd choose to fall.
I chose to fall.
With no more remorse, I'll turn this all around,
Change my direction about how to get around this.
I'll lay this at the alter, these chains have broken free.
In can't hold me, you will help me.
