Your secret voices
Know what I won't forget
I can fight only seeing my tracks
There's nothing the same
This is my pale horse
This is my gold digger [x2]
Great white consuming
Take me in your arms
In your arms
Great giver of mercy
Surround me with your presence
With your presence
But I can feel your arms around me
Your unconditional love
It's how you speak
It's where you find me
Now bring me to my knees
He will never forsake...
You, I will never forsake you
You, so here I come
Here I come
You think your alone
You're not alone [x3]
Wake up I am coming to you
Wake up I am coming
