It's Your light that guides me
Welcoming a brand new life, my path has been set straight
I'm dancing with this fire, I'm dancing with the flame
You say that this scares you, He knows this as well
Go in the right path and you shall not fail
And now I'm walking on my mistakes
It's all where I'm going, not where I've been
You're the blood of love's creation
Let life begin
Cinderella, Cinderella
Night and day, it's Cinderella
(Guide my heart)
Keep me here, keep me here
I've gotta stay, I've gotta stay
We are living, we are standing here [2x]
We are living, we are living
Take my hand, I'll show you everything
No questions remain
This is a war
