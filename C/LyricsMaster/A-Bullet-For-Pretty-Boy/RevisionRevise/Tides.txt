We've been here for far too long.
We turn our backs
When we know that you're always there.
We've been here before.
It's far too familiar.
We continue to choose
To turn our back.
It's not easy being strong,
It's not easy.
We've let this fade
Like a tide washing away.
There's something inside us
That we can't create.
We have to fight to be strong,
We have to be strong to fight.
The battle isn't over,
And the war has just begun.
What is it that we need?
Something to fill this void!
We've been here for far too long.
We turn our backs
When we know that you're always there.
We've been here before.
It's far too familiar.
We continue to choose
To turn our back.
It's not easy being strong,
It's not easy.
The battle isn't over, the battle isn't over!
The battle isn't over
And the war has just begun.
This is the beginning.
The battle isn't over
And the war has just begun.
