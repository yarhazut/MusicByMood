We are at the end of the rope
With nowhere to run
We can blame it on ourselves
We are the blind
Scriptures have revealed the facts
Satan has a hold of us
We found a reason to believe
Grasp this truth
Behold the truth
We sit and wait for the worst to come
We have to claim what's ours
Rebuke the wicked
And break these chains
Nothing can hold us down
Appalled by the truth
What's a lie
We sit and wait for the worst to come
We have to claim what is ours
Open your heart
My words wont be hollow
