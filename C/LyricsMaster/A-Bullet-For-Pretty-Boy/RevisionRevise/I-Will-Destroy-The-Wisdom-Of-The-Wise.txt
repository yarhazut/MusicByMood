I can't look at what we've done
And make it all ok
All hope is found in you
We know it's found in you
Take us and let us see
All we need is to see
Let us carry on through the night
It's like they poisoned us overnight
How much can they take
We all need to take charge
(We can wake them)
Speak now and save this world
When silence is deafening
When silence is deafening
The world is set aflame
God is real
And we stand strong
Speak now and save this world
So write this down
As it comes
As a reminder
For when your lost
This shall come to mind
All was offered
All was offered
We are not of this world
We are of God
We have become so
Lost in how we think it is supposed to be
Let us become one
Voice because we were meant to sing
We look to you father
The day has actually come
Where they will tell us lies
These words are not in the book
Don't tell us what you think
Don't preach to us in vane
Tell us about the truth
I have come to destroy the wisdom
I have come to destroy the wise
I have come to destroy the wisdom
(Of the wise)
