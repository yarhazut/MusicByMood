The messengers are being hunted.
A dream come true, the nightmare continues.
The killing of innocent men.
Because of their beliefs, conflict arises.
Will this come to me?
A true statement of faith.
Cut me open
To see what I am really like.
Push me and test me.
I know where my heart lies.
The day will come
When they will put you to the test, to the test!
Push me and test me.
I know where my heart lies.
The day will come
When they put you to the test.
Push me and test me.
I know where my heart lies.
The day will come
When they put you to the test.
Tortured and beaten,
We shatter like glass.
Tortured and beaten,
We shatter like glass.
Tortured and beaten,
We shatter like glass.
Tortured and beaten,
We shatter like glass.
We shatter like glass.
Will you rise above?
The day will come to make a choice.
The day will come to make a decision.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Stand your ground.
Stand your ground.
Stand your ground.
