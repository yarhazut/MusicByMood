Weakness of our bodies
Can't make us climb these walls.
Will we break the awful patterns
Before the end is here?
I'm in need of something more.
I'm stuck in a shallow grave.
I've been here before,
So Lord, lend me your hand.
I've been here before
In this endless cycle.
I've fallen once again.
I've fallen once again,
And with this empty feeling,
I seek forgiveness
And await the answer.
Action without movement,
Await the answer.
Desire without heart.
The voices in our heads
(The weakness of our bodies)
Can make us climb these walls.
Why is it so hard to listen to the
Voice inside our heads?
It feels so close,
Yet so far away.
It feels so close,
Yet so far away.
Even the wind and waves obey Him.
What's there to fear?
Give us strength to overcome this downfall,
To stand to our feet,
And break these awful patterns.
Give us strength to overcome this downfall,
To stand to our feet,
And break these awful patterns.
The voices in our heads
(The weakness of our bodies)
Can make us climb these walls.
We will break these awful patterns
Before the end is here, 
Before the end is here.
Why is it so hard to hear your voice when you're right here?
Why is it so hard to hear your voice right now?
