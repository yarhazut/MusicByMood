How can we bridge the path from dark to light
If we live like the rest. 
Can we portray his love?
We are the Window
What we do is for you
Can we be your hands?
Burn these walls
Let your light shine through this veil
Burn these walls 
Let your light shine through
We are the Window
We must set our own hearts 
Straight to lead the weak
We give ourselves to you 
To see the truth within in your hands
Oh God take it all
Fill my lungs
Give me life
We were hollow men
We were hollow men 
Consume me
I am choosing what I will let decide
Who I will become
With all this shame pulling at my feet
I will run to you
What can I do
To make this wretch pure
All of me
Use all of me for you
We must set our own hearts 
Straight to lead the weak into the promise land
You still Give us hope
This is my flesh
Nothing more than a book 
Of redemption and regrets
This is my flesh
Nothing more than a book 
Of redemption and regrets
Burn these walls
Let your light shine through this veil
Burn these walls 
Let your light shine through
