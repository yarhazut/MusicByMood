Take a look into yourself.
Mark my words!
The way of the fool is the path you chose.
You will not mock me or my god.
I've said this before and I'll say it again.
Until you hear my words,
You will not find the answer.
I will never leave your side.
If you take my hand, I will be right here.
I will never leave your side.
If you take my hand, I will be here.
Wisdom calls out loud in the street.
You love your simple ways, you hate your life.
Wisdom calls out loud in the street.
You love your simple ways, you hate your life that's full of lies.
Full of lies, full of lies!
So eat the fruit
Of your actions, and take my hand
Now... 
I'll be waiting for you, while you're fighting off your back.
I'll be waiting right by your side
And I will stretch out my hands, give you my offering.
Welcome this one, true love.
This is our offering.
I've said this before and I'll say it again.
Until you hear my words,
You will not find the answer.
I've said this before and I'll say it again.
Until you hear my words,
You will not find the answers.
I've said this before and I'll say it again.
Until you hear my words,
You will not find the answers.
