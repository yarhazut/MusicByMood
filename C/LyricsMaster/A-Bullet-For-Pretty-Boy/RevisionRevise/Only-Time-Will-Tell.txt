Never where we seen the past, (Never where we seen the past)
Take what I've said.
All the lies that you caved into. (All the lies that you caved into)
Never where we seen the past, (Never where we seen the past)
Take what I've said.
All the lies that you caved into.
Into, every time this tension.
Every time this precious chaos.
This is my darkest hour.
Let's get to this and make a prediction about it all, (It all)
Removing that picture perfect notion (Notion)
Let's get to this and make a prediction about it all,
Removing that picture perfect notion.
Give me your hand, give me your words.
I'm giving you my heart,
Now show me your signs.
Such an awful feeling.
Such an awful feeling.
I scream. I need.
Don't fight, we're sinning to what you said.
To show you the lovely portions. [x2]
Ignorance is there. (It's with you)
Ignorance is left when you're taking me with (You)
What if this was my last chance (My last chance)
What if this was my last chance to save you.
You don't know where to go,
Or how to start.
Take a look at what you've become. [x4]
You don't know where to go,
Or how to start.
Take a look at what you've become. [x2]
Watch it; we all get up and run,
Why can't we see?
Your eyes are for me.
Just let it take my hand.
With eternal love for eternity.
