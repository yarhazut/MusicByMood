You
Are not allowed to get old
I told you so
You're not allowed to go
Not now
Now
You're not supposed to leave
Now
You're not supposed to leave
Not now
Not ever
Where is your soul
Where is your soul
Where is your heart
Where is your heart
You are not allowed to get old
I told you so
You're not allowed to go
Not now
Now
You're not supposed to leave
Now
You're not supposed to leave
Not now
Not ever
Where is your soul
Where is your soul
Where is your heart
Where is your heart
Where is your soul
You are not allowed to leave
You are not allowed to be
Released
From this cold world
You are not allowed to get cold
I want you with everything I hold
Not now
Not allowed to get cold
Where is your soul
Where is your soul
Where is your heart
Where is your heart
Where is your heart
Where is your heart
