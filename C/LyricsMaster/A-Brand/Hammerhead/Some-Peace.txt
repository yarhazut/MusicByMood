Slightly out of control we thought we had it all
But that night when I called you a fraud
Things got out of hand.
Slightly out of our minds we were just wasting time
And you see my friend there is no end
Unless you land face down on the ground
And I need some peace of mind x2
And you realize x2
You collect mistakes like they're postcards from exotic places
And you realize you were pissing in your own backyard
While you should have said hey and solved the problem
Slightly out of our minds we were just wasting time x2
