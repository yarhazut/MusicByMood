She has a way of doing what she's doing
Without saying what she is aiming for.
And out of nowhere she denies any relation
Acting all surprised.
Come on
You interrupt my high,
Come on
You interrupt my high, high, high, high,
Goodness gracious, leave me be
I tell you what you wanna hear
And if I'm not you turn the plot
The way you want me to say it.
