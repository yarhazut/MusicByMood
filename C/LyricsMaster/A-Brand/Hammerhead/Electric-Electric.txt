I need a wire straight to my veins
I need the shocks, the shakes until I do the monkey
I need shots down in flames
I need the shocks, the shakes till I do the monkey
I need to shake until it hurts
I need the shocks until it aches
I need the shivers, the shivers
Vertebra by vertebra, time and time we electrify your spine
All you girls pretty committed to shaking
And breaking and easin' and pleasin' and beggin'
Till I till I do the monkey
All you girls shake your tambourines
You know what it means
When I do the monkey
We're only here to excite you x3
We wanna hear guitar x12
