Wipe that seaman off your teeth and sing it like you mean it
Conviction that's the key
A perfect match in perfect heaven.
Wipe that seaman off your face and sing it like you need it
Don't question your belief. Go out out out and do it.
Give the people what they need
Beauty booty killer queen
Give the people what they need
Beauty booty beauty booty beauty booty
Killer queen x2 beauty booty beauty booty killer queen x2
Delicious delight me lick you very much because I like x2
Don't be uptight x4
Excuse me
You're on top off my list
Exquisite me
It must be lust
All in a haze
I'm gonna butter you up
All in a haze
I'm gonna do you right
Now listen to me Lucifer
You're a shark and a possum
A dolphin and a snake
It was nice doing business with you
But will you stop playing god for a change.
