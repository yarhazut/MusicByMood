Don't let yourself get hurt this time
Who is to keep who's to decline?
Making amends is not my style don't get me started, she says
No use repeating same old lines
No use backtracking good old times
The ones you want are not always the ones that make you happy
And thus she steps into the night
Her pocket stuffed with nose delight
Nine lifes for clubbin' wonder wich fits the best
U-turn, 180
U-turn, facing the failure
U-turn, on parole
Flip chart lovin'
She knows the goal
U-turn, 180
U-turn, facing the failure
U-turn, back for more
Flip chart lovin'
She knows the score
Disconnect the brains
Vanity obeys
Jumpin' to forget
Nighttime bouncing in the discotheque
Feel the beat, hit the floor
Time to settle the score
'Cause forever and more
She'll be closin' the door
Got a mind of her own
Got a mind of her own
Got a mind of her own
She knows the score
