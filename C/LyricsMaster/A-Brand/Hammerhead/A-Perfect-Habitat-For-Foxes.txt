We broke up in a dream [x4]
I can't explain, I can't explain
We broke up in a dream
(x2)
We broke down in a plane [x4]
I can't explain, I can't explain
We broke down in a plane
(x2)
Lay down time, lay down your love
Lay yourself down for a while
Lay down time, rest your mind
A perfect habitat for foxes
I can't explain, I can't explain
We made up in a haze
I can't explain, I can't explain
A perfect habitat for foxes
The world, a house, a place to live in
In the place, a man forgiven
In the house, a girl, a kitten
A tear, resolved, the sky, lit up
Rejoice, rejoice, the curtain's lifted
Pleasure, pleasure out of the ordinary
A rock, a house, a hill to live upon
The sky, a well, the grass to depend upon
I can't explain, I can't explain
We still live in a dream
(x4)
A perfect habitat for foxes
