Nobody told me this shit I had to get used to it
Niggas thinkin' I'm buggin they think I'm losing it
Micheal Jordan I'm ballin they think I'm hoopin it

Ayo that's word to my F it ain't no hoe in me
A nigga talk behind my back that's a hoe to me
A nigga gave me his word and then he told on me
He ain't really hold it down, how its supposed to be
I shouldve put him in the ground, how its supposed to be
Bodies tryin' to get found while I'm rollin' weed
Ski mask I'm hoping that they don't notice me
Choppa knock a nigga down on purpose
Ill pull up with a fuckin' Trey Pound on pupose (Ah)
Ra Sosa got a thottie on me twerkin'
