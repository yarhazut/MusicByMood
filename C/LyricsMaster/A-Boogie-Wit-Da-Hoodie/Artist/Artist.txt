I promised you would've liked it
If I was invited
She said she wanna be mine
She wasn't with it to ride
I had to kick her a side
I know it just ain't right
But baby you was invited
I promised you would've liked it
She know I be on my grind
So I don't really have time
To hit you back on time
I would've been in your life
But I just wasn't invited
I think that I would've liked it
I was exited I thought you was mine
You were really wasting my time
But damn I can't lie
She ride the pipe like she bike it
You was the rock to my diamond
The way we could've been shining
We would've been fine
But girl you had to decide
I thought that you was my type
I wish that I could rewind it
But I guess I'll never mind it
Tell me what you want
Tell me why you fronting?
Is this really what you wanted ? keep it a hunnit
Every time you started fussing
I changed the subject
Every time you hear this song is gon' get you upset
You gon' hear it in they headphones on the bar set
If I see you up in public straight Stuntin'
Cop another pair of Mains then I go to London
Would've put you on a plane in some Red Bottoms
She said she wanna be mine
She wasn't with it to ride
I had to kick her a side
I know it just ain't right
But baby you was invited
I promised you would've liked it
She know I be on my grind
So I don't really have time
To hit you back on time
I would've been in your life
But I just wasn't invited
I think that I would've liked it
You was a slide
I don't think I can look at you in ya eyes
You cheated on me and lied
And I think you liked it
You're so damn trifling
You was a thot and I wifed it
There's no one like this
Look at my ice you could've been right beside it
I'm still thug lightening
(?) License you my lil Light skin
'Cause I know she gon' hide it
You prolly think I'm bluffing
I ain't Frontin' I turn nothing into something
Now I'm Stuntin it's just us I won't switch up yeah
I love my Bousins others talk behind my back
So I can't trust them
Oh I think I started something now they upset
Everybody I came up with I'm still stuck with
Every girl that I was with I had no love with
Now all I ever wanna do is boss shit
She said she wanna be mine
She wasn't with it to ride
I had to kick her a side
I know it just ain't right
But baby you was invited
I promised you would've liked it
She know I be on my grind
So I don't really have time
To hit you back on time
I would've been in your life
But I just wasn't invited
I think that I would've liked it
Why you think my name is Artist ? I'm an Artist
