Now I'm saying what's good with you
I remember being in the hall with you
I still think about you
Fuck all the phony shit
Fuck it I'm stuck on some doly shit
Had a knife in my back when I wrote this shit
I look back and I laugh when I noticed it
I shoot up and lean back on some Kobe Shit
They don't know how to pass on some Kobe shit
Should've listened my mom always told me this
I was only thirteen when she told me this:
"Watch who you fuck with
And never ever trust a nigga for nothing
Even if you feel like you really love her
Don't ever tell that bitch that you really love her
'Cause that's when she's gon' make you feel like you nothing
And that's when you gon' start to feel like you buggin'
I wish I wouldve never told you wassup
And I wish I never even told you pull up
Got me saying what's good with you
I remember being in the hall with you
Everything was always on the stove with you
Girl I even bust a couple jaws with you
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you
Said you always gon' be there for me
Now you gone and you just disappeared on me
Can't believe I really thought you cared for me
You was supposed to be the one that's here with me
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you
I hope that I never see you again
I don't wanna put up with it
I don't wanna fuck with it
Imma just send you this letter whenever I'm done with it
I know you gon' read it
I called you a bitch at the end
I don't know if I mean it
I ain't wanna believe what my niggas was telling me
My nigga I should've cheated
And now I feel stupid
I should've knew better than this
Wasn't the right way to do it
I should've been choosing the money instead of a bitch
Fuck it 'cause I'm getting
Just watch how I do it
I knew I was ready for this
Bitch imma focus on music
You love how I do it
I knew I was ready for this
Got me saying what's good with you
I remember being in the hall with you
Everything was always on the stove with you
Girl I even bust a couple jaws with you
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you
Said you always gon' be there for me
Now you gone and you just disappeared on me
Can't believe I really thought you cared for me
You was supposed to be the one that's here with me
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you
But all I can say is you dumb hard
You got me feeling stupid
You got me singing all these love songs
What the fuck am I doing
I don't know what I'm doing
But I'm going up though I just hope I don't lose it
Bitches picking and choosing
But I know wassup tho
I already been through it
We could've been balling together
Hit up the mall its whatever
You know that I started from nothing
Them bitches was fed up
The way you made all of them jealous
You said that you was gon' ride forever and ever
You told me forever and ever
I should've known you was lied
I should've known better you lied I should've knew better
