Leave me to be alone in these deeper depths of Hell, 
My Hell of pain and despair 
Everything is lost, I can't seem to find the past. 
I wish a death upon myself. 
No connection to the world but to the tree above: 
It waves to me with the wind. 
Shouting to the heavens, I curse your name in vein: 
"Where are you now to save a helpless soul?!" 
Crying in the night and overwhelmed by your hatred 
Can't find the reason why you punish me: insanity! 
I lived a simple life of purely purity, 
Thus you take away my life and give me nothingness! 
A man who is too feeble to merely hang himself, 
Stuck here on the freezing ground: "Oh so cold, oh so cold!" 
"I want to die, please let me die!" 
With no answer, he lives eternal gloom 
Why can't you leave 
Me to die now?
