Standing beneath the moon 
The rain hides my tears 
I can't seem to find 
Reason to live like this: 
In constant desperation 
For this, what I can't have. 
So I sharpen the razors 
And I slit my wrists. 
Oh so painful 
Yet so gainful 
It calls to me! 
Unleash thyself! 
To kill yourself 
A fine choice 
No one wants you here 
You're a fucking disgrace 
Cry on your own shoulder 
No one cares about you 
You've proven as a coward 
And an honorless fool
