Look at the stars above. 
Don't they make you wonder? 
Is there something up there? 
Does life have no meaning? 
Such a beautiful world 
But life goes so wrong: 
The innocent lay dead 
As the murderers arise. 
Oh dear God is dead! 
Such a famous phrase. 
Our poor children die 
As our morning mothers cry. 
Where is He now? 
Hes not by our side! 
These wars are over Him: 
An imagined being. 
You all dream of lies, cowards, 
And waste your lives day by day! 
I would choose Antichrist 
Before falling to your fable!
