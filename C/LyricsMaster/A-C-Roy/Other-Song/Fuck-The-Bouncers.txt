Me and my pals were going up the town
Thought there was nothing that could get us down
Two litres of cider before we went out
I'm hoping to break this terrible drought... but!
The bouncer said "got any i.d?"
I didn't so he humbl't me!
We're not getting in anywhere (fuck the bouncers)
I said "fuck you!", 'cause I don't care (fuck the bouncers)
We're not getting in anywhere (fuck the bouncers)
I said "fuck you!", 'cause I don't care (fuck the bouncers)
He's fat, he's bald, he's a fascist prick
He'll only let you in if you suck his dick
Well he's only trying to do his job
But that's no excuse to whip out his knob...
