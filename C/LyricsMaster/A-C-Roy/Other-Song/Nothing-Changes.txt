Space is fine and night is cold
'The king' is cool, is so I'm told
Nothing left to bring me down
Sell your soul all over town
Space is empty, like my head
Go back where angels fear to tread
'Cause nothing left now to desire
Catch the sun and you're on fire
This is the best day of my life
This is the best life of the day, are you ok?
Not when time is all you've got
Kiss the girl then lose the plot
Living life at stupid speed
Still waiting for your ears to bleed
'Cause space is fine, night is cold
Live my life, do what I'm told
Nothing changes or stays the same
But what's my name?
This is the best day of my life
This is the best life of the day, are you ok?
This is the best day of my life
Are you okay?
This is the best day of my life
Are you okay?
This is the best day of my life
Are you okay?
This is the best day of my life...
