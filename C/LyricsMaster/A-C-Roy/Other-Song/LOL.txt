There's no coke in coca-cola
It's no joke, this century
There's no future in Scotland's dreaming
Life's not all that it should be
That's super-weak dude, that's super-weak
That's super-weak dude as far as I can see...

Rage_fan_602 laughs out loud (lol)

There's no point in revolution
When the TV's punk tonight
Lose yourself in thought pollution
Out of mind and out of sight
That's super-weak dude, that's super-weak
That's super-weak dude a farce as you can see...

Don't talk to me about the birds and bees
Don't talk to me about the birds and bees
Don't talk to me about the birds and bees
Don't talk to me at all
