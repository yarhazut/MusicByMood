How I wonder what you are
Burn up like a shooting star
All she does and all she says
It's just 9 million, many dead
Are you the daughter of a kamakaze pilot?
I'm amazed how much you grew
Been on my feet for 3 hours at least
And I'm way too blue to see you...
Living in this little town
Tired of being here on the ground
Now I'm down on my knees
Can't see the forest for the tree
Hang the daughter of a kamakaze pilot
I'm amazed how much you grew
Been on my feet for 3 hours at least
And I'm way too blue to see you...
How I wonder what you are
Burn up like a shooting star
All she does and all she says
It's just 9 million, many dead
Hang the daughter of a kamakaze pilot
I'm amazed how much you grew
Been on my feet for 3 hours at least
