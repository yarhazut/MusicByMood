We like to rock
We like to roll
We like to smash our amps and
Lose control
In your little punk band
One night stand
You got blisters now
On your hand
Your head is full of rage
Try and act your age
Try to grow up for a while
You got your hair dyed
So you'd be desired
By some gothic girl
But she wasn't inspired
You said that you'd tell her
How you felt one day
Send her a letter
When (if) you moved away
Your head is full of rage
Try and act your age
Try to grow up for a while
One day you'd show them
How you're emnat to play
Go down like a rocket
In the u s of a
So play your guitar
And you will go far
Straight from the suburbs comes
A brand new star
Your head is full of rage
Try and act your age
Try to grow up for a while
Your head is full of rage
Try and act your age
Try to grow up for a while
