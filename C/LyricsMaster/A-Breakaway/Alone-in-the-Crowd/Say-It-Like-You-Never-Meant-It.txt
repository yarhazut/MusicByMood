I'll take a lifetime to make these thoughts turn into words
They'll form then they'll watch you recede because they'll never be heard
Behind those barricade eyes, destruction rules in her mind
We think in life but only live in moments so let's stop thinking tonight
Well, I'm in a war with awkward silence
I lost my mind in your bloodshot eyes
You're really hot when you're so defiant
Without a chaser we would chase away the night
We're gonna drive around this small town
Just wanna find out what you think of me
You make me crazy when you let your hair down
We're falling over and it's getting hard to breathe...
It's getting hard to fucking breathe
We are the ones, we are the ones
We're gonna live now while we can
We're holding on, We're holding on
Let's make an exit, not an end of hope and we're all a disaster
The best damn nights that we still can't remember
Tonight you're not in love with me
You're in love with the party scene
You're walking into my room like you own the place
You found the attitude but I can't find the things to say
To say to you...
And now she's taking her clothes off
I got a feeling they're bogus
Oh my God
It's crazy, we're never gonna sleep
We are the ones, we are the ones
We're gonna live now while we can
We're holding on, We're holding on
Let's make an exit, not an end of hope and we're all a disaster
The best damn nights that we still can't remember
The summer comes and we'll think of it after
How you almost made it; you almost asked her
Tonight you're not in love with me
You're in love with the party scene
I'll take a lifetime to make these thoughts turn into words
They'll form then they'll watch you recede because they'll never be heard
Behind those barricade eyes, destruction rules in her mind
We think in life but only live in moments so let's stop thinking tonight
