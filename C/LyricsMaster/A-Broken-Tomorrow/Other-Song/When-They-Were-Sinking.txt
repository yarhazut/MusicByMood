He with power, strike me down
Redden my seas and I'll feel depths below frustration
Send to me, plague after fucking plague
Let the locusts, feed upon my body
Lead us not to blind faith, go paint your blood
On another doorway
Treason never felt so good
When belief, flows through the fatuous
Where were you?
When there was only one way out?
When they were sinking to the seabed
They prey to the heavens
With no return
Oh this earth is yours
As is the right, to show some respect
We refuse to concede
So abort the burial of this hatchet
Abort the burial of this hatchet
And I will part the seas to
Find a way to
Writhe in the torment of every
Innocent life that's been torn
To fucking shreds
To fucking shreds
So now we rise
And face this kingdom
The holy ghost now haunts this abyss
So now we rise
We're burning down his empire
His city of light now buried in darkness
Where were you?
When there was only one way out?
When they were sinking to the seabed
They prey to the heavens
With no return
Where were you?
When there was only one way out?
When they were sinking to the seabed
They prey to the heavens
With no return
With no return.
