So what will you prove
Now what will you choose
When you've got no one but yourself to blame
I'm sick of these games, so sick of these games
And in the end you'll be the one to lose
This is the last time
I'll be hearing you calling out my name again
This is the last time
Ill believe anything that you will say
Can you feel this?
Do you hear this?
Your choices have consequences
Tell me your sorry
And ill believe everything
Everybody knows how good you are with lying
You say you love the way it makes you feel
You've lost what's real
