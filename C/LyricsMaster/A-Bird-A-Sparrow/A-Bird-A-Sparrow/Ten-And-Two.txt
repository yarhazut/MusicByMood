Erase these dreams I never had
It turns again but never look back
We'll never go back
Delete these sheets I failed to save
Words can't describe the day
And I can't speak tonight
Never look back
Never hold back
Gotta get back
To the places we once loved
So I can sleep tonight
Embrace these streets I've never crossed
It turns again and we might be lost
But we're well on our way
We lost our way back home
And we drive around for miles
Just to see the open road
I can see it comin'
Lets keep driving
Just keep driving
Lets keep driving
Just keep driving
We've gotta find our way home
