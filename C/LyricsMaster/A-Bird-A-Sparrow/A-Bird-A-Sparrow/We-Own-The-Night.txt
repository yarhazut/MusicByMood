I'll take the flight out of California sun
Through the terminal gates...
I feel so lost sometimes, another sun fades away
Oh how the time goes by
Raise up your glasses, I wanna make a toast
Tonight we'll celebrate till we have nothing left to say
This wont be the same without you
We'll keep dreaming till its true
Take me through all of this, last night just moved so quick
You'll be the first thing that I see when this is over
Try not to think of this
When the lights hit our faces you know its on
We'll bring the beat so you can keep your feet moving
You are my everything, you are my melody
That keeps me singing in the right key
This wont be the same without you
We'll keep dreaming till its true
Take me through all of this, last night just moved so quick
You'll be the first thing that I see when this is over
Try not to think of this
Take me through all of this, you've got me over it
You'll be the first thing that I see when this is over
Last night just moved so quick, you've got me over it
Count down the days and we'll be on our way
I'll take the flight out of California sun
Through the terminal gates until our damage is done
Take me through all of this, last night just moved so quick
You'll be the first thing that I see when this is over
Try not to think of this
