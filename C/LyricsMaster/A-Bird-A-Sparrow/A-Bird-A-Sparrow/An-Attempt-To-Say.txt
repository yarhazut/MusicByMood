I remember every word you said to me
I remember every breath you stole
And that wont get you very far now
I will know it and soon you will know it too
Lets play our cards and hope for the best
Distractions and setbacks predicting the outcome
I will know it and soon you will know it too
Lets run away as fast as we can
To a place where no one has ever been
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't afraid
As long as your here I'll be here to stay
Are there words that are sweet enough to say?
Everything that I wanted to explain
The way you take my breath away
I know we'll have nothing but the best intentions
I'm always caught between these miles
And my wild ambitions
Ill hold my breath till I see you
So don't mind me if I look a little blue
I want to save every gasp of air
To make sure...
