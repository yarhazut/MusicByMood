You'll come back, they always come back
This was meant to hurt you
Following the beat to an empty orchestra your teeth dance out of step, out of time
You really thought I was crying for you? Self proclaimed fairest of them all
I do it so the skin will know but it's never enough
"I can't help my feelings" spoken like a true female
Don't look now, but your hopes have died in the mirrors
Were waiting for the donor to pick the shards of glass out
