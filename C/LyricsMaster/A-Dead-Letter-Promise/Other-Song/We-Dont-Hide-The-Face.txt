Sell yourself for a dime a dozen lucky numbers
Let it all slip away, the silent release
You danced like a marionette, twirling as each shot rang out
I'm reloading in the distance and you better run while you still got the chance
I've been waiting for you to call the ground home
I'm giving up, it's over
Come lay with me
I'm giving up on my dreams of you and a better life
It's over
