I know the lies you told and who you told them to
I know everything you didn't think anyone knew
She's lost in the sheets
Tangled in darkness
Finding a way out, someday
If we make it to the hills by sunrise I'll hide with you
We walked arm in arm, while love walks hand in hand
It makes more sense for you to be typical
Let go of my fucking hand
Lets cross our fingers and pray
It's so cold in here already
It was your last breath and the most poetic thing that you could think to say was "oh shit"
