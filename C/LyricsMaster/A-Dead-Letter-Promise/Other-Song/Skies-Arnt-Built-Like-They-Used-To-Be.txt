Not a dry eye in the house, but I caught you laughing
Id love to hurt you on the parade to the funeral
For the first time in a long time I have found what it feels like to be held in the arms of a loved one, and held so tight
Are we alone yet? Then your the only thing I have to get rid of
I never wanted it to end like this
With you faced down in a puddle of your own blood
The first kiss from your lips felt like an angel falling from heaven
I never felt closer to god
