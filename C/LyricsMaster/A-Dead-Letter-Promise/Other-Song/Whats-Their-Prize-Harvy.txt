The audience roars in approval
Lets let the silence sink in
Something a little bit more humble
If you can stay I won't fight
It's going to take all you are
A thankless trying task
But baby you've got status
It finds a home in my headache
Fill her up, bartender
So my body makes her more than home
"Would you like to come inside?" How elegant they choke when there's a bone stuck in our throat
These are the words that breed eating disorders
The traces of a struggle leave a crude smile in the sand
Swat the fly's from fathers leftovers and call forensics to the loft
This ones going to take a while since there's such lust for this sunken ship
And like always, I'm silent in my victory
