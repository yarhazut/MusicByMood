Terror began
Or it will happen eventually
I do
I do
Demand and command the tendencies of fly's
I'm only waiting for the time to let you down
Were not the ones on trial here
Ready now? I'm only waiting for the time to let you down
Ready now? I won't die from natural causes
Ready now
I know it will happen eventually
Bravest hunters roam in packs, why your practically a gladiator
Consider me the reigning king of coded messages
