Your more fashionable when you wear my heart on your teeth
My only fashion statement is wearing your mascara on my finger tips, and I can't even look at you right now
Slow down darling you make love like an expert
I can tell you've done this before, or somebody's been practicing
Yeah, someone's been practicing
Familiarity
I've dance this dance before
Your getting better at denial
You don't win friends with secrets
Laugh it up
I'm getting good at this
Look what you have become
Don't thank me, its useless unless you us it
What are you waiting on? It's your move
Hey hotel floor, it's been a while
We really should keep in touch
Now only I remain
The sex is better when you fight me
This child needs medical attention
