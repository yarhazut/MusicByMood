Here we go again, another night of being bummed
I can tell myself I'll avoid the sun and cancel plans with everyone I know 'cause this is how it always ends
Our bonds will break 'cause you can't relate to anyone, to anything at all
You brought your worst, and I'm right here, though I've seen it all
It's never been so clear
You're not the person that I knew back then
It's not too late to set this right 'cause everything has been
You're not the person that I knew back then
Let's try to act like this didn't happen
Follow your friends like you ever had them
You still know me
Still not cut out for this sort of thing
Never wanna be caught in between
I need constant reminders of everything
So what?
It's who I am; I played it off so well
I just hold it in no matter how I've been, so nobody, nobody can tell
You brought your worst, and I'm right here, though I've seen it all
It's never been so clear
You're not the person that I knew back then
It's not too late to set this right 'cause everything has been
You're not the person that I knew back them
Let's try to act like this didn't happen
You follow your friends like you ever had them
I won't sleep 'til the break of dawn, break of dawn
I can't wear our problems from here, so everybody come on
You brought your worst and I'm right here, though I've seen it all
It's never been so clear
You're not the person that I knew back then
It's not too late to set this right 'cause everything has been
You're not the person that I knew back then
Let's try and act like this didn't happen
Follow your friends like you ever had them
You're not the person that I knew back then
It's not too late to set this right 'cause everything has been
You're not the person that I knew back then
Let's try and act like this didn't happen
Follow your friends like you ever had them
