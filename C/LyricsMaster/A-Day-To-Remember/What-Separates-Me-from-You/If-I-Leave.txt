Let's Go!
In the beginning I was up front
Nothing to think about, you'd always hear me out
We made a pact and never gave up
When everything would change, we'd always stay the same
Something went wrong along the way
You'd come around and there's nothing left to say
It's like we're strangers anyway, what more could you ask of me
It's been a long time coming, but everyone's gonna hear me now
If I leave, bet you'll wish I'd stayed
Make you regret all the things you said to me
You know that time can't help us now,
If I leave this, if I leave this way.
I've always been a man of action,
Never let anything keep ahold of me
Can always tell when somethings missing,
Like I knew everything except for you and me
I can't make you want to stay, I'll take a shot but it's broken anyway
I still gave it everything, I guess I never catch my break
It's been a long time coming, but everyone's gonna hear me now
If I leave, bet you'll wish I'd stayed
Make you regret all the things you said to me
You know that time can't help us now,
You know that time can't help us now,
If I leave I should move away,
And try to right all the wrongs we've ever made
We'll let your problems weight me down
If I leave this, if I leave this way.
Never thought you'd be the last one standing
Never thought that we would come this far
You'll always be there looking over my shoulder
Come to terms with exactly what we are
Never thought you'd be the last one standing
Never thought that we would come this far
You'll always be there looking over my shoulder
Come to terms with exactly what we are
If I leave, bet you'll wish I'd stayed
Make you regret all the things you said to me
You know that time can't help us now,
You know that time can't help us now,
If I leave I should move away,
And try to right all the wrongs we've ever made
We'll let your problems weight me down
If I leave this, if I leave this way.
Never thought you'd be the last one standing
Never thought that we would come this far
You'll always be there looking over my shoulder
If I leave this, if I leave this way.
Yeah!
