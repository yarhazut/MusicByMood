Don't get me started on what it means to be alive.
You're lying to yourself and then still you act surprised.
'Cause you're scared, can't come to terms with what you are.
The wolves in sheep's clothing will only lead you so far.
You'll wait, and they'll go
Cause in the end we all end up alone.
So just wait. You'll know.
Forget everything just for tonight.
We'll sing like everyone when they're alone
'Cause I've been waiting for tonight
To sing whoa-oh, whoa-oh
I rely on myself, just making sure that was clear.
I'm not in need of your crutches, I've faced all my fears.
And I won what I knew I could have.
Life is not a punch card, make the best of what you have.
But don't wait, just go.
And when you find yourself please, let me know.
It's not too late, just let go.
Forget everything just for tonight.
We'll sing like everyone when they're alone
'Cause I've been waiting for tonight
To sing whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Let's believe that if we all stand together,
We're a force that can shake the whole world.
For once I'm doing something right when we sing
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
In the end it's not about what you have.
In the end it's all about where you want to go
And the roads you take to help you get there.
I hope you think that's fair
'Cause you've only got one life to lead.
So don't take for granted those little things.
Those little things are all that we have.
Forget everything just for tonight.
We'll sing like everyone when they're alone
'Cause I've been waiting for tonight
To sing whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Let's believe that if we all stand together,
We're a force that can shake the whole world.
For once I'm doing something right when we sing
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
I sing whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Everything, everything
'Cause I've been waiting for the night to sing
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
