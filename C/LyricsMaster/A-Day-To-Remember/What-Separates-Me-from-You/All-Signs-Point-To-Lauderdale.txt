I hate this town
It's so washed up
And all my friends don't give a fuck
They'll tell me that it's just bad luck
When will I find where I fit in?
Two, three, four!
Remember when I tried
I never strayed too far from you
Forever by your side
No matter what I was going through
But now I never know the things to say to you
That help me prove that I'm still on your side
I never show just what you do to me
Guess I was always wrong
I hate this town
It's so washed up
And all my friends don't give a fuck
They'll tell me that it's just bad luck
When will I find where I fit in?
I hate this town
'Cause no one can understand, I just can't be dragged down
Nothing comes between me and my plans
So now I never know the things to say to you
That help me prove that I'm still on your side
I never show just what you do to me
Guess I was always wrong
I hate this town
It's so washed up
And all my friends don't give a fuck
They'll tell me that it's just bad luck
When will I find where I fit in?
And don't believe a word they're telling to you
Don't believe a word they're telling to you
They let me down
When will I find where I fit in?
I hate this town
What a world, come on never bring me down
Everything I had is turning back around
Cause our times were something
Bigger than both you and me
I can't live my life always backing down
I've gotta do this right and they can't make a sound
'Cause I'm not here for nothing
'Least I can say I stand for something
You and me we stand for something
I hate this town
It's so washed up
And all my friends don't give a fuck
They'll tell me that it's just bad luck
When will I find where I fit in?
And don't believe a word they're telling to you
Don't believe a word they're telling to you
They let me down
When will I find where I fit in?
I hate this town
I hate this town...
