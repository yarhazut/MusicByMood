I wonder if you'll notice, If they lock me up and throw away the key
Try to be open minded, you've got a lot to learn in the ways of me
You always got to say something
I'm none of your concern but you won't listen at all
You know I'd rather say nothing
And just be proud of myself for tearing down these walls
When you fall I'll be the only one who looks away
When you call I'll be the first to tell you I can't stay
It's all over, I found a better way to help keep you from me
I'm better off this way, woah-oh, woah-oh
I'm better off this way, woah-oh, woah-oh
You gotta keep this coming
Tell it like you know it but you don't know nothing
Your call, we can settle this like gentlemen
Or meet me out the back to end it all and start again
My whole life's spent waiting
Ever since I can remember been anticipating your fall
And God let it be a long one
Can't let go of my grudge till I know you're done
When you fall I'll be the only one who looks away
When you call I'll be the first to tell you I can't stay
It's all over, I found a better way to help keep you from me
I'm better off this way, woah-oh, woah-oh
I'm better off this way, woah-oh, woah-oh
You want it, you've got it
You've always been such a waste of time
You want it, you've got it
A friend of yours is no friend of mine
You want it, you've got it
When will you act your age
You want it, you've got it
You're the reason things have to change
Woah-oh, woah-oh
You're the reason things have to change
Woah-oh, woah-oh
When you fall I'll be the only one who looks away
When you call I'll be the first to tell you I can't stay
It's all over, I found a better way to help keep you from me
I'm better off this way
Woah-oh, woah-oh
I'm better off this way
Woah-oh, woah-oh
I'm better off this way
