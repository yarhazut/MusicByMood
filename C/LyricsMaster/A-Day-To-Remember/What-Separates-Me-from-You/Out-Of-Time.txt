I've never felt so sober
I've never felt the low that I feel tonight
Your words made everything drag on, and on
I finally found her, and when I did I just couldn't make things right
Is this really happening, oh god I think I just ruined my life
What the fuck am I doing?
I can't tell the difference from wrong and right
I can guess my decisions
'Cause I haven't been this person in my whole life
I think I need something new here
When I keep longing for what I had
No need for second opinions
I do the best I can to ruin what I have
Come on
Don't think you've got to go in alone here
I've got nothing left to hide
Your dying just make up your mind
I thought this was what you wanted
Someone who gets everything right (Gets everything right)
I thought this was what you wanted
Someone to put you first in their life
'Cause we're running out of time
Something just from the new year
Hey, Hey, Hey
It's a moment that's not as bad
It's what's a part of my vision
The optimistic me, so we can make this last but no
You ruined my favorite records
By singing them then I think of you
That's just hope you remember
All of the guilt inside, and I believed in you for once
Don't think you've got to go in alone here
I've got nothing left to hide
Your time, just make up your mind
I thought this was what you wanted
Someone who gets everything right (Gets everything right)
I thought this was what you wanted
Someone to put you first in their life
'Cause we're running out of time
Just know that it kills me
When I hear anything to do with you
You will see, oh believe me
I need to be right where you are
And know that I'm leaving, leaving
And you won't hear for a year from now
And this kills me. cause now I think that everything everything was about you
I thought this was what you wanted
Someone who gets everything right (Gets everything right)
I thought this was what you wanted
Someone to put you first in their life
'Cause we're running out of time
Don't think you've got to go in alone here
I've got nothing left to hide
Your time, just make up your mind
