I'm a mess
That's the best way to describe it
I leave no time to myself
The only way I can fight it
When I'm alone
It's like I'm staring into a mirror
Don't know the person inside it
And that's never been any clearer
I miss your family and I miss all our friends
If you had it to do over, would you do it over again?
'Cause I would, it means something more to me
There's a hole in my heart where you use to be
I still wish you the best of luck, baby
And don't go thinking that this was a waste of time
I couldn't forget you if I tried.
You killed what was left of the good in me
I'm tired so let me be broken
Look down at the mess that's in front of me
No other words need be spoken
And I've got nobody else to blame though I tried
Kept all of my past mistakes down inside
I'll live with regret for my whole life
I confess, that I brought this all on my self
Condemned to suffer alone, like there's nobody else
When you're gone, it's like a whole part of me's missing
So I'll keep living the lie and just hope that you're listening
I tried to make us a life here
But our foundation was built on sand
No time to run until the damage was done
I never had the upper hand
I still wish you the best of luck baby
And don't go thinking this was a waste of time
I couldn't forget you if I tried
You killed what was left of the good in me
I'm tired so let me be broken
Look down at the mess that's in front of me
No other words need be spoken
And I've got nobody else to blame though I tried
Kept all of our past mistakes held inside
I'll live with regret for my whole life
All the things you love are all the things I hate
How did we get here in the first place?
I play it cool but it's hard to be (All my trust)
All my trust is slowly fading inside of me (Over what?)
There can't be any more progress, I know our fate
Only thing that can heal this is time and space
You killed what was left of the good in me
I'm tired so let me be broken
Look down at the mess that's in front of me
No other words need be spoken
And I've got nobody else to blame though I tried
Kept all our past mistakes held inside
I'll live with regret for my whole life
For my whole life
