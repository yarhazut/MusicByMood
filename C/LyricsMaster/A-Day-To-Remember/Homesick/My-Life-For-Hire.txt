Somebody give me a sign that everything's going as planned.
And then everything falls away into the darkness of this shallow place.
The detail's striking.
The room's cold and frightening.
You'll kick and you'll scream.
You'll try everything to survive, but you should know your fate by now.
They told me, they told me how I should be, but I broke the mold somehow.
It's too late, too late.
You keep trying to resolve the past right now, but I swear I'll be the one to let world know what you've done to me.
You, you know you gotta assert yourself.
Leave what you need for now, it's not the time or place you're searching for.
All I can give them's my worst of intentions.
You're nothing to me, and everyone can see that.
Your life's a lie.
There's nowhere left to hide.
They told me, they told me how I should be, but I broke the mold somehow.
It's too late, too late.
You keep trying to resolve the past right now, but I swear I'll be the one to let the world know what you've done.
It's too late, too late.
You keep trying to resolve the past right now, but I swear I'll be the one to let the world know what you've done.
Watch your back, you'll lose yourself.
This is a battleground.
When will they know your life's a lie?
It's too late, too late.
You keep trying to resolve the past right now, but I swear I'll be the one to let the world know what you've done.
It's too late, too late.
You keep trying to resolve the past right now, but I swear I'll be the one to let the world know what you've done.
They told me, they told me how I should be, but I broke the mold somehow.
