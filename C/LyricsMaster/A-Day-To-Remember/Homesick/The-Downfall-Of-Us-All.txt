Let's go!
It's not easy making a name for yourself.
Where do you draw the line?
I never thought I'd be in this far.
Let's have some fun and never change, not for anyone.
Try not to miss me when I'm gone.
I Sold my soul to the open road.
I'll live my life alone.
You won't find me in the same spot.
Believe me, I could never stop.
My life's turned upside down.
Meet me out past the train tracks.
I'm leaving and not coming back.
You're right and I was wrong.
This town will be the downfall of us all.
I'm gonna need you to try to follow along.
I did the best I could to try and write you songs.
Now, go tell them we sold out, like we're the ones who changed.
I write what I feel, I say what I feel; you can't buy sincerity.
I sold my soul to the open road.
I'll live my life alone.
You won't find me in the same spot.
Believe me, I could never stop.
My life's turned upside down.
Meet me out past the train tracks.
I'm leaving and not coming back.
You're right and I was wrong.
This town will be the downfall of us all.
Don't forget yourselves.
We made up our minds, and we signed three, four, five on that dotted line.
Don't forget yourselves.
We made up our minds, and we signed three, four, five on that dotted line.
You won't find me in the same spot.
Believe me, I could never stop.
My life's turned upside down.
Meet me out past the train tracks.
I'm leaving and not coming back.
You're right and I was wrong.
You won't find me in the same spot.
You were right and I was wrong.
Believe me, I could never stop.
You point the blame, we'll take the fall.
My life's turned upside down.
Meet me out past the train tracks.
You were right and I was wrong.
I'm leaving and not coming back.
You point the blame, we'll take the fall.
You were right and I was wrong.
This town will be the downfall of us all.
This town will be the downfall of us all.
Downfall of us all.
Downfall of us all.
Downfall of us all.
Downfall of us all.
