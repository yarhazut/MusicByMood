And hey darling, I hope you're good tonight
And I know you don't feel right when I'm leaving
Yeah, I want it, but no, I don't need it
Tell me something sweet to get me by
'Cause I can't come back home till they're singin'
La, la la la, la la la
Till everyone is singin'
If you can wait till I get home (I get home)
Then I swear to you that we can make this last (La la la)
If you can wait till I get home (I get home)
Then I swear come tomorrow, this will all be in our past
Well, it might be for the best
And hey sweetie, well I need you here tonight
And I know that you don't wanna be leaving
Yeah, you want it, but I, I can't help it
I just feel complete when you're by my side
But I know you can't come home till they're singin'
La, la la la, la la la
Till everyone is singin'
La, la la la, la la la
If you can wait till I get home (I get home)
Then I swear to you that we can make this last (La la la)
If you can wait till I get home (I get home)
Then I swear come tomorrow, this will all be in our past
Well, it might be for the best
You know you can't give me what I need
And even though you mean so much to me
I can't wait through everything
Is this really happening?
I swear I'll never be happy again
And don't you dare say, we can just be friends
I'm not some boy that you can sway
We knew it'd happen eventually
La, la la la, la la la
Now everybody's singin'
La, la la la, la la la
Now everybody's singin'
La, la la la, la la la
(If you can wait till I get home)
Now everybody's singin'
La, la la la, la la la
(Then I swear we can make this last)
Now everybody's singin'
La, la la la, la la la
(If you can wait till I get home)
Now everybody's singin'
La, la la la, la la la
(Then I swear we can make this last)
Now everybody's singin'
La
