Everything around me seems so much different than where I'm from, and at this rate, I think my fate's sealed.
This life's so unpredictable.
We'll go continue to live a life that no one knows.
Where's this gonna go?
Right here, right now, this is the beginning of the end, and I won't sing a single thing until we can get this right.
I'm moving on.
I'm moving on.
Hey mom, I wrote you some soft songs, and tell dad I'm just fine.
We had to choose; we made our moves, and now we got to go, go.
Everything about me seemed so much different when I was young.
I couldn't wait to take my place.
Five years have passed, good god, have I been gone?
So why?
I've never felt so alone in my whole life.
Time's not on my side.
Right here, right now, this is the beginning of the end, and I won't sing a single thing until we can get this right.
I'm moving on.
I'm moving on.
Hey mom, I wrote you some soft songs, and tell dad I'm just fine.
We had to choose; we made our moves, and now we got to go.
And why's this make me so nervous?
Why does everything go wrong?
Why's this make me so nervous?
Why does everything go wrong?
I'm holding on to a fairy tale.
We're moving forward, but we're not there yet.
I'm holding on to a fairy tale.
We're moving forward.
We're moving forward.
I'm holding on to a fairy tale.
We're moving forward, but we're not there yet.
I'm holding on to a fairy tale.
We're moving forward.
We're moving forward.
Hey mom, I wrote you some soft songs, and tell dad I'm just fine.
We had to choose; we made our moves, and now we got to go.
And why's that make me so nervous?
You make me so, you make me so.
Why does everything go wrong?
Why's this make me so nervous?
You make me so, you make me so.
Why does everything go wrong?
