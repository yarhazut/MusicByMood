Have faith in me 'cause there are things I've seen I don't believe
So cling to what you know and never let go
You should know things aren't always what they seem
I said I'd never let you go and I never did
I said I'd never let you fall and I always meant it
If you didn't have this chance then I never did
You'll always find me right there again
I'm going crazy 'cause there are things in the streets I don't believe
So we'll pretend it's alright, pretend it's alright, and stay in for a night
Oh, what a world, I'll keep you safe here with me, with me
I said I'd never let you go and I never did
I said I'd never let you fall and I always meant it
If you didn't have this chance then I never did
You'll always find me right there again
I said I'd never let you go and I never did
I said I'd never let you fall and I always meant it
If you didn't have this chance then I never did
You'll always find me right here again
They've got me on the outside looking in, but I can't see at all
With the weight of the world on my shoulders, they just wanna see me fall
They've got me on the outside looking in, but I can't see at all
With the weight of the world on my shoulders, they just wanna see me fall
Have faith in me
I said I'd never let you go and I never did
I said I'd never let you fall and I always meant it
If you didn't have the chance then I never did
You'll always find me right there again
I said I'd never let you go and I never did
I said I'd never let you fall and I always meant it
If you didn't have the chance then I never did
You'll always find me right there again
I said I'd never let you go and I never did
I said I'd never let you go and I never did
I said I'd never let you go and I never did
I said I'd never let you go and I never did
