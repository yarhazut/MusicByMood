Get up, get out, this is your wake-up call.
We run this town, and you can't fight us all.
We keep 'em coming back for more.
Don't think you can hold us down, we'll tear this building down.
Try to be careful what you say.
Give it up, your tact is astounding.
Find your peace and leave us with some peace of mind.
You do this every time.
So here's to another banner year.
We've crossed that thin line, don't try to hold us here.
If, just for this once, you'd think of us, I hope you're happy with yourself.
Get up, get out, who's gonna break your fall?
When we don't back down, you're gonna seem so small.
We keep 'em running for the door.
Just wait, things will come back around.
It's too late for them, they're heading for a meltdown.
I'm not part of your clich√©.
Give it up, your tact is astounding.
Find your place and leave us with some peace of mind.
You do this every time.
So here's to another banner year.
We've crossed that thin line.
Don't try to hold us here.
If, just for this once, you'd think of us, I hope you're happy with yourself.

If, just for this once, you'd think of us, I hope you're happy with yourself.
Just think about, just think about everything.
Be careful now, be careful what you say while I'm away
This is the life we chose; this is the life I lead.
They can never take this from me.
