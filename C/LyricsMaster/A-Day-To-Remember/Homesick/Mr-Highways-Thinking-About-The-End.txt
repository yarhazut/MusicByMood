Wake up!
Oh, how the times have changed.
You're not the person that I knew back then.
Let's get this straight, this is a calling.
When will they stop falling for this?
You lack all inspiration.
We're not the same.
I'll do whatever it takes to get it through to you.
We'll call this a day.
We're not the same.
You are worthless; stay in your place.
It's like speaking in tongues to all of you know.
When will we ever, when will we ever get what we deserve?
How long until the tables turn?
When will we ever, when will we ever get what we deserve?
I've created a monster.
You bring out a side of me that no one should see.
So quit stalling, pack your bags, keep walking away.
Your life leads to destruction.
We are not the same.
I've struggled for too long to sit back and let you take this from me.
We are not the same.
I have given everything.
It's like speaking in tongues to all of you now.
When will we ever, when will we ever get what we deserve?
How long until the tables turn?
When will we ever, when will we ever get what we deserve?
Get what we deserve, get what we deserve, get what we deserve
Disrespect your surroundings.
You won't make it out alive.
You won't make it out alive.
You won't make it out alive.
You won't make it out alive.
It's like speaking in tongues to all of you now.
When will we ever, when will we ever get what we deserve?
How long until the tables turn?
When will we ever, when will we ever get what we deserve?
When will we ever get what we deserve?
When will we ever get what we deserve?
