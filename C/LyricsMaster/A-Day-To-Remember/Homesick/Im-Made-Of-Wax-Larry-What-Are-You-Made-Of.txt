Don't blink, they won't even miss you at all
And don't think that I'll always be gone
You know I've got you like a puppet in the palm of my hand
(Don't you let me down!)
So run like hell
Sleep with one eye open
I can't forgive, or forget you
We'll tell everyone the damage done
Deep down you can't stop me
You can't stop me now
I'll be there
Just to watch you fall
So don't push me
I've got nothing to lose
Don't blink, they won't even miss you at all
And don't think that I'll always be gone
You know I've got you like a puppet in the palm of my hand
(Don't you let me down!)
Oops there I go again
I made it so damn hard
To come back from the mess that you're in
I need you to know, I told you so
You're a snake, and I'm cautious
Just use your head
I'll be there
Just to watch you fall
So don't push me
I've got nothing to lose
Don't blink, they won't even miss you at all
And don't think that I'll always be gone
You know I've got you like a puppet in the palm of my hand
Don't you let me down!
Don't blink, they won't even miss you at all
And don't think that I'll always be gone
You know I've got you like a puppet in the palm of my hand
Don't you let me down!
Come on!
Everybody's out to get me
Any moment could be my last
This is me
You can take it or leave
Right or wrong
I will stand on my two feet, just breathe
Just breathe!
Don't blink
They won't even miss you at all
And don't think
That I'll always be gone
You know I've got you like a puppet
In the palm of my hand
Don't you let me down!
Don't blink
They won't even miss you at all
And don't think
That I'll always be gone
You know I've got you like a puppet
In the palm of my hand
Don't you let me down!
