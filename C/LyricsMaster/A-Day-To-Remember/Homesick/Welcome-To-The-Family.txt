We're finally alone at last.
Oh, how I've waited for this day to come.
There's just something about you that rubs me wrong.
You're not worth my attention.
I built this with my own two hands.
If you could spare me the time, stop using me as your next misconception.
I don't believe that everything you've known about me is gone forever.
And I won't forget the days that we spent forever; it haunts me.
I don't believe that everything you've know about me is gone forever.
And I won't forget the days that we spent forever; it haunts me.
It won't be long before you meet your end.
You're nothing but a passing trend, so keep those cameras rolling.
You think I wouldn't remember?
You thought that I would lose faith in myself?
You can spare me the lies; you don't believe in me.
Your life's a contradiction.
I don't believe that everything you've known about me is gone forever.
And I won't forget the days that we spent forever; it haunts me.
I don't believe that everything you've known about me is gone forever.
And I won't forget the days that we spent forever; it haunts me.
We draw the line at being in your life.
Here's to the man of the hour.
We'll cast our problems aside.
Cheers to your future.
May they bury you alive.
I don't believe that everything you've known about me is gone forever.
And I won't forget the days that we spent forever; it haunts me.
I don't believe that everything you've known about me is gone forever.
And I won't forget the days that we spent forever; it haunts me.
