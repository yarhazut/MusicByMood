Been through a lot in the last year
It's like everything I love is slipping away
And every time I come home
Some more of me isn't there
I've gotta get it together
I need to do things for myself
I've given everything
But still you take more from me
I need some room to breathe
Come on, come on
You know this isn't what we planned on
(You know this isn't what we planned)
Come on, come on
Tell me we'll be okay
(We'll be okay)
Let's go back, let's go back
To a time where I still felt I had a family
This isn't what I remember
Everyone's looking out for just themselves
If need be, I'll be happy to leave
Just be warned, I'll be taking most of you with me
I see straight through
That smile, straight through
That painted face
Don't think that I can't tell
Which one of you is against me
Come on, come on
You know this isn't what we planned on
(You know this isn't what we planned)
Come on, come on
Tell me we'll be okay
(We'll be okay)
Let's go back, let's go back
To a time where I still felt I had a family
I have the greatest faith in fools
I turned my back and out came the wolves
Pay attention
Come on, come on
You know this isn't what we planned on
(You know this isn't what we planned)
Come on, come on
Tell me we'll be okay
(We'll be okay)
Let's go back (Go back)
Let's go back (Go back)
To a time where I still felt I had a family
Been through a lot in the last year
It's like everything I love is slipping away
