They keep playing sad songs on the radio
And I feel like I'm so alone
On this 15 hour drive
And all the while I tell my self to just believe
'Cause nobody can give so much
And never get anything
(Never get anything)
Everyone I used to know
Says they don't know what I've become
But I'm still the same, not much has changed
I still know where I came from
I fell asleep with the lights on
And I can see that you're the first one in a long time
That had some faith in me
(Have faith in me)
I tell my friends, we won't be long
The Florida sun begs me to come back home
And it feels like I'm ready for anything
If you can wait for me
And all the while I say too much of what I think
And I can't remember what it's like
To find meaning in anything
For the life of me
Everyone I used to know
Says they don't know what I've become
But I'm still the same, not much has changed
I still know where I came from
And all I ever wanted was
So far from what I need
I'll write my songs, so sing along
I know time heals everything
I fell asleep with the lights on
And I can see that you're the first one in a long time
That had some faith in me
(Have faith in me)
I tell my friends, we won't be long
The Florida sun begs me to come back home
And it feels like I'm ready for anything
If you can wait for me
This is all I have
This is all I have
It's my life
This is all I have
This is all I have
I fell asleep with the lights on
And I can see that you're the first one in a long time
That had some faith in me
(Have faith in me)
I tell my friends, we won't be long
The Florida sun begs me to come back home
And it feels like I'm ready for anything
If you can wait for me
I fell asleep with the lights on (Lights on)
And I can see that you're the first one in a long time
That had some faith in me
(Have faith in me)
I tell my friends, we won't be long (Won't be long)
The Florida sun begs me to come back home
And it feels like I'm ready for anything
If you can wait for me
