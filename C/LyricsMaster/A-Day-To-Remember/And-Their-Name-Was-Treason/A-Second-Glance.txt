This is for you.
This is for you.
You're the one worth waiting for.
You're all I ever needed in this life.
Let's take a look back so we can see what it took to bring us here and we're so reminded of better days, when we were both happy.
This is for you.
This is for you.
You're the one worth waiting for.
You're all I ever needed in this life.
This is for you.
This is for you.
You're the one worth waiting for.
You're all all I ever needed in this life.
Words can't express the impact you've made on me, and in my entire life.
And all I can say is that I love you for everything it turned out to be.
This is for you.
This is for you.
You're the one worth waiting for.
You're all I ever needed in this life.
This is for you.
This is for you.
You're the one worth waiting for.
You're all I ever needed in this life.
'Cause I try so hard to make this right, right.
You've got my back on the wall.
After all you've put me through, my friends still stay true.
After all you've put me through, my friends still stay true.
Your reign is over.
Why couldn't you prove me wrong?
Your reign is over.
Why couldn't you prove me wrong?
