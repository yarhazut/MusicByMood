If actions spoke louder than words, you'd have me deaf by now.
You make it seem so easy to love me for who I really am, am.
It'd break my heart if we fell apart.
It'd be so hard to let you go.
It'd break my heart if we fell apart.
It'd be so hard to watch you go.
So let's not dwell on all those things we should've said.
As piece by piece I can pick you up off of my floor, off my floor.
So let's not dwell on all those things we should've said.
As piece by piece I can pick you up off of my floor, off my floor.
It's so crazy how it'd make my week just to hear them mention your name.
Is it so hard to understand how you've got me right in the palm of your hand?
It'd break my heart if we fell apart.
It'd be so hard to let you go.
It'd break my heart if we fell apart.
It'd be so hard to watch you go.
So let's not dwell on all those things we should've said.
As piece by piece I can pick you up off of my floor, off my floor.
So let's not dwell on all those things we should've said.
As piece by piece I can pick you up off of my floor, off my floor.
You're first and foremost; you're always on my mind.
Through the songs that I'll sing, I'll give you my heart.
You're first and foremost; you're always on my mind.

My floor.
My floor.
My floor.
My floor.
