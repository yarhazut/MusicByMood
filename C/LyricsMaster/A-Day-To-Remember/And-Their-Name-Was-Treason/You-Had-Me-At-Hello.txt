I'm missing you so much.
I'll see you die tonight just so I can get to you before the sun will rise.
I know the signs are on and I feel this too.
None of that ever seems to matter when I'm holding you.
And I'm wasting away, away from you.
And I'm wasting away, away from you.
What have I gotten into this time around?
I know that I had sworn I'd never trust anyone again. but I didn't have to.
You had me at hello.
I've never seen a smile that can light the room like yours.
It's simply radiant.
I feel more with every day that goes by.
I watch the clock to make my timing just right.
Would it be okay?
Would it be okay if I took your breath away?
And I'm wasting away, away from you.
And I'm wasting away, away from you.
What have I gotten into this time around?
I know that I had sworn I'd never trust again, but I didn't have to.
You had me at hello.
You gave me butterflies at the mailbox.
