So I say goodbye to a town that has eyes and ears.
I can hear you whispering as I walk by.
Familiar faces smiling back at me, and I knew this would make them change.
The only thing that's going to bother me is that you'll all call yourselves my friends.
Why can't you look me in the eyes one last time?
The writing's on the wall.
You've read that I'll be gone, but if you call my name, just know that I'll come running for one more night to spare with you.
This is where I'm meant to be.
Please don't leave me.
I've read these stories a thousand times, and now I'll rewrite them all.
You're meddling in an anger you can't control.
She means the world to me, so hold your serpent tongue.
Is a whore's lies worth dying for?
I'll take my time.

I walked into your house this morning.
I brought the gun from our end table.
Your blood was strewn across the walls.
They'll find you on your bathroom floor.

You blood was strewn across the walls.
They'll find you on your bathroom floor when I'm done.
But should I write it off?
But should I write it off?
But should I write it off?
You should have killed me when you had the chance.
But should I?
You should have killed me when you had the chance.
You should have killed me when you had the chance.
You should have killed me when you had the chance.
