And shepherds we shall be, for thee, my lord, for thee.
Power hath descended forth from thy hand, that our feet may swiftly carry out thy command.
So we shall flow river forth to thee, and teeming with souls it ever will be.
In nomine patris, et fillis, et spiritus sancti.
You've sunk lower than I've ever seen.
And even though you deserve this, I tried to catch your fall.
I've grown so tired of your childish threats.
Know that I'll never run from anything.
And I'll burn the building if I knew you'd die.
And I'll pray you're a failure.
And that you won't make it out alive.
And I'll burn the building if I knew you'd die.
And I'll pray you're a failure.
And you won't make it out alive.
Here's where we prove your fairy tales wrong.
This all stops tonight.
Swim in your sea of smoke until your lungs lose the fight.
It's over.
This all stops tonight.
Or prove me wrong.
What have you become through your jealousy?
You've threatened my life, my friends and family.
This is your last wrong turn in your life and this dead end leads to a blood bath.
Your blood bath.
And I'll burn the building if I knew you'd die.
And I'll pray you're a failure.
And that you won't make it out alive.
And I'll burn the building if I knew you'd die.
And I'll pray you're a failure.
And that you won't make it out alive.
Here's where we prove all your fairy tales wrong.
This all stops tonight.
Swim in your sea of smoke until your lungs lose the fight.
It's over.
This all stops tonight.
Or prove me wrong.
You'll never stop us with your one-man army.
We would burn him alive.
You'll never stop us with your one-man army.
If you're such a man, then bring the fight.
You'll never stop us with your one-man army.
We would burn him alive.
You'll never stop us with your one-man army.
If you're such a man, then bring the fight.
This is me calling you out.
You want to talk like a man, then be a man.
Stop talking like you're something.

You always have so much to say, but it's never to our faces.
I'm right here.
We're paging 1958.
We're all one and the same.
We're moving on and living our dreams.
We're paging 1958.
We're all one and the same.
We're moving on and living our dreams.
We're paging 1958.
