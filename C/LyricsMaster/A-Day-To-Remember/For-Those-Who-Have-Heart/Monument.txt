It's Monday morning, and I would kill for the chance to drive.
Get so far away from here with you, my dear, that I'll never leave your side.
Nobody knows the troubles I've seen in a van, on a soapbox for the world to see.
Miles away, and I wish this didn't mean so much to me.
To be a monument for the rest of them.
Miles away, and I wish this didn't mean so much to me.
To be a monument for the rest of them.
We're getting older.
I've started to fear for my life.
Is this the way that it should be?
This whole thing's riding on me.
It's been a long road so far with nowhere to turn.
There's no looking back from here, no more dwelling on my fears.
Miles away, and I wish this didn't mean so much to me.
To be a monument for the rest of them.
Miles away, and I wish this didn't mean so much to me.
To be a monument for the rest of them.
Twenty bucks says you'll remember me when you see me on you TV screen.
It may be the first time, but it won't be the last time.

Twenty buck says you'll remember me when you see me on your TV screen.
It may be the first time, but it won't be the last time.
And I'll scream so loud that everyone in this place will hear every word I say 'cause this is my time.
This is my time to shine, let nothing stand in our way.
