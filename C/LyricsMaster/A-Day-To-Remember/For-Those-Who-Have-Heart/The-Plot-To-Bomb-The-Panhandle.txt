I've learned to let go
Come on
Here's a middle finger coming straight from Ocala
I appreciate your judgement
It's proved that I can't trust a word you say
Those must be some pair of binoculars that you can see every move I make
So I'll never be a liar, but you'll always be two-faced
You'll get what's coming to you
You're blinded by your instincts
I'm not your fucking game
I'm not so easily beat
I'm looking down at this mess that you've made
And I can't believe that I stayed so unhappy for so long
Where did I go wrong?
I've got to get out of this
My hand is on the handle
We're leaving everything behind
Goodbye for a lifetime
I'll rip that scandalous bitch in two
We'll being the noise
Try to pretend that I never even knew your name
'Cause everything you are disgusts me
Too bad I can't turn back time
So I wouldn't be here
What I'd give for you to disappear
So tell me, girly, how's your edge?
You've got nothing better to do
I know why you can't see straight
I thought you were better than this, but you're just like everyone else
I'm looking down at this mess that you've made
And I can't believe that I stayed so unhappy for so long
Where did I go wrong?
I've got to get out of this
My hand is on the handle
We're leaving everything behind
Goodbye for a lifetime
I'll make my stand right here with my friends
I'll make my stand right here with my friends
I'll make my stand right here with my friends
I'll make my stand right here with my friends
I'll make my stand right here with my friends
Get low
Now I know who my friends are
I'm never coming home
