Tonight, I'm sending you a message.
This is the end of an era, the end of second chances.
In the face of defeat, I'm winning.
Yet, you still have so much to say.
Oh, they're coming straight for me.
Oh, they're coming straight for me.
Read between the lines.
We can't give in this time.
Just let me go.
For now, I'll be just fine, just let me go.
Don't ya know?
Don't ya know, now that I'm back on my own.
Just let me go for now.
I'll be just fine, just fine, don't ya know, don't ya know, now that I'm back on my own.
Tell me how to feels to watch the walls of your security crumble.
I remember you.
You took the easy way out when I gave you something to stand for.
Oh, they're coming straight for me.
Oh, they're coming straight for me.
Read between the lines.
We can't give in this time.
Just let me go.
For now, I'll be just fine.
Just let me go, don't ya know, don't ya know, now that I'm back on my own.
Just let me go.
For now, I'll be just fine, just fine, don't ya know, don't ya know, now that I'm back on my own.
I was just another promise that you couldn't keep.
I was just another promise that you couldn't keep.
Read between the lines.
We can't give in this time.
Just let me go.
For now, I'll be just fine.
Just let me go, don't ya know, now that I'm back on my own.
Just let me go.
For now, I'll be just fine, just fine, don't ya know, don't ya know, now that I'm back on my own.
