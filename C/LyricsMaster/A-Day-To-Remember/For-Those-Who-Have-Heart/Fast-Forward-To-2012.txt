We welcome you to the second chapter.
Thanks for turning the other page.
We acknowledge you as the only reason for the progress that we've made.
You're a constant reminder.
We came, we saw, we conquered.
Everything has come so far from where we were before.
We'll keep this short and sweet, so I'll get to the point.
My friends come first, it's the bottom line.
My friends come first, it's the bottom line.
My friends come first, it's the bottom line.
My friends come first, it's the bottom line.
That's the bottom line.
Here's to the future, never getting older.
When the tables do turn, where will you be?
Pick up your feet.
