Here's to the past.
Let's all think back on what brought us here.
This is my grasp on what is real.
Don't tell me how I feel.
With all that's passed, I can't relate with myself from day to day.
Why does everything seem so far away to me.
There's no turning back from here.
I've got to get away from everyone who's left, everyone who's left.
I'll tell the saddest story of how I made it through this past year.
I'll tell the saddest story of how I made it through this past year.
They said we'd walk away.
You'll never make it if you can't speak for yourself.
They said we'd fade away.
We've all been down this path before.
You're trapped in this town, and it wears you down.
When we leave today, then maybe you'll understand this constant struggle isn't always in the palm of my hand.
There's no turning back from here.
I've got to get away from everyone who's left, everyone who's left.
I'll tell the saddest story of how we made it through this past year.
I'll tell the saddest story of how we made it through this past year.
They said we'd walk away.
You'll never make it if you can't speak for yourself.
They said we'd fade away.
This man will stand the test of time.
This man will stand the test of time.
This man will stand the test of time.
This man will stand the test of time.
I'll tell the saddest story of how we made it through this past year.
I'll tell the saddest story of how we made it through this past year.
They said we'd walk away.
You'll never make it if you can't speak for yourself.
