So now you'll know exactly what it fells like to be an obstacle in my way.
You won't remain.
You won't remain.
Save your breath, don't even speak.
If you'll speak of change 'cause you won't.
You won't cut to the chase.
Spare the lecture on what it takes to make a man.
'Cause you're weak and I'm strong.
I will never falter; I'll stand my ground.
You're a fake, a worthless coward.
You're like won't mean anything.
I will never falter; I'll stand my ground.
You're a fake, a worthless coward.
Your life won't mean anything.
So now you'll know exactly what it feels like to be an obstacle in my way.
You won't remain.
You won't remain.
Let's set things straight.
What's done is done.
I never needed you.
Tell me exactly who do you think you're kidding?
Everyone will be happy when they find that you're missing.
You asked if we'd ever forget you.
We've got our fingers crossed, our fingers crossed.
That's the danger in starting a fire.
You'll never know how many bridges you'll burn.
That's the danger in starting a fire.
You'll never know how many bridges you'll burn.
