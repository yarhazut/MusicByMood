Hey boys, look where we are.
This town ain't big enough for the both of us, so get ready to run.
This all goes to show just how little you really know about the way that we are.
I notice everything, like every rumor that you spread today.
You're never gonna change.
Let's set this record straight.
I know all your dirty secrets that you kept from me.
This conversation's over.
Watch your step.

This town can chew you up and spit you out, so pardon me, but you shouldn't be so proud.

You're all the same.
You think that everyone around you cares about what you think.
No one knows your name.
It's about that time, take everyone you know and get as far across my state's line as you possibly can.
I notice everything, like every single rumor that you spread today.
You're never gonna change.

Will this time be for too long?
Wait 'til then, and see if time brings change.
