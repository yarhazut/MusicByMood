This is my vengeance for all the wrongs you've formed against us.
You always get me wrong.
My whole existence revolves around the progress that we've made.
I'll never be walked on again.
I'm on the edge of the rooftop, thinking nobody will ever know.
I hope that you'd want to be the one to see the distance from the road.
I'm on the edge of the rooftop, thinking nobody will ever know.
I hope that you'd want to be the one to see the distance from the road.
This is our triumph over all the forms of filth you've spread.
We'll never let this go.
Right from the very start, I knew this day would come.
Tonight's the night we silence you.
There's nowhere left to run.
I'm on the edge of the rooftop, thinking nobody will ever know.
I hope that you'd want to be the one to see the distance from the road.
I'm on the edge of the rooftop, thinking nobody will ever know.
I hope that you'd want to be the one to see the distance from the road.
Let this be a reminder.
I'm everything that you wanted to be.
Hope for the best, but it's over.
And you thought you were better than me.
I'm on the edge of the rooftop, thinking nobody will ever know.
I hope that you'd want to be the one to see the distance from the road.
I'm on the edge of the rooftop, thinking nobody will ever know.
I hope that you'd want to be the one to see the distance from the road, the road, the road, the road, the road.
Such a pretty picture, your chalk line on the ground.
I hope you die.
