Let's take them back to the days when we were family.
My breath was your breath when we were young.
I think it's funny how the times have changed.
Throw being jealous in the mix, and now all I know of you is a name.
Couldn't have came at a better time.
This ends right now.
We gave all of ourselves to entertain you.
We're only hurting ourselves.
We gave all of ourselves to entertain you.
We're only hurting ourselves.
I'm a god amongst the ants and your girlfriends, and you act like you don't even know.
It's 'cause you haven't been here for too long.
I called this right from the start.
I turn my back for one second, now all I hear is a shot in the dark.
Use my name like you know me.
You're all the same.
Keep running your mouth.
Keep running your mouth.
We gave all of ourselves to entertain you.
We're only hurting us.
We gave all of ourselves to entertain you.
We're only hurting ourselves.
Hurting ourselves.
Hurting ourselves.
Hurting ourselves.
Mark my words, we're taking over the world.
Mark my words, we're taking over the world.
Mark my words, we're taking over the world.
Mark my words, we're taking over the world.
