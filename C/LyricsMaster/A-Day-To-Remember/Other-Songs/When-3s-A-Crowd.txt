I went to sleep thinking about you,
And I woke up just the same.
You made it so hard for me 
To close my eyes.
Don't worry babe, 
This will be alright,
In the end.
And I will be your everything.
So we'll go tell ourselves, 
That this is for the best.
But I'm depending on you to lead me through.
So try to stop those hands,
You're writhing down my neck.
You touch; I tremble.
You never were one to play fair.
These patched four walls won't be 
The only thing,
That's keeping me from you.
This distance could never hold us back. [I need you]
So let's just take this time and,
We'll use it for reflection,
And I'll see you in three days and,
You'll think of me when you're next to him.
Don't mind my gasping
It's so much harder to breathe when you're near
You made it so hard for me to avert my eyes
Don't mind my asking, but could it trouble you miss,
For a smile?
Grant me one last: wish with a kiss 
It's what my tears are made of
So we'll go tell ourselves, 
That this is for the best.
But I'm depending on you to lead me through.
So try to stop those hands,
You're writhing down my neck.
You touch; I tremble.
You never were one to play fair.
These patched four walls won't be
The only thing, 
That's keeping me from you.
This distance could never hold us back. [I need you]
So let's just take this time and,
We'll use it for reflection,
And I'll see you in three days and,
You'll think of me when you're next to him.
So here we are, 
Again.
In the same situation.
I'm screaming at the top of my lungs,
And you're not saying a word.
Can't you just say what you mean,
Or can't you just mean what you said?
When you said no one will love you like me...
These patched four walls won't be
The only thing, 
That's keeping me from you.
This distance could never hold us back. [I need you]
So let's just take this time and,
We'll use it for reflection,
And I'll see you in three days and,
You'll think of me when you're next to him.
These patched four walls won't be
The only thing, 
That's keeping me from you.
This distance could never hold us back. [I need you]
So let's just take this time and,
We'll use it for reflection,
And I'll see you in three days and,
You'll think of me when you're next to him.
