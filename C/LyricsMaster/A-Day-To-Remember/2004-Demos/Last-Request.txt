I've noticed the way you've changed
Over three years
And we've all stayed the same
Look back through the past
Yet, we all knew that you wouldn't last
You see yourself
In the puddles
Left from the rain
And all we remember
Is your stain
Just look at your life
Live it for yourself
And be happy
So you're wrong in the way you wanted to be
The only one who matters is you
The want to slip away
To your ledge
You chosen finailly
You picked your role and played your part
But what you didn't know was this play is a tragedy
You see yourself
In the puddles
Left from the rain
And all we remember
Is your stain
Just live your life
Live it for yourself
And be happy
So you're wrong in the way she wanted to be
The only one who matters is you
What you waiting for
I bet you didn't know where we were coming from
What you waiting for
I bet you didn't know where we were coming from
What you waiting for
I bet you didn't know where we were coming from
Cause it breaks my heart
Cause it breaks my heart
Cause it breaks my heart
Cause it breaks my heart
Cause it breaks
Just live your life
Live it for yourself
And be happy
So you're wrong in the way you wanted to be
The only one who matters is
What you waiting for
I bet you didn't know where we were coming from
What you waiting for
I bet you didn't know where we were coming from
What you waiting for
I bet you didn't know where we were coming from
