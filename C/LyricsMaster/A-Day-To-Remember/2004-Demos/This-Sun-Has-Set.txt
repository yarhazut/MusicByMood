This sun has set on your heart
Chances for redemption 
And I have forgotten your name
And I thought it'd be easy
To move on completely
Forgetting what was real and what was
Forget the past, Don't for once think you're better than what I have.
You're the reason I never trusted anyone.
Forget the past, Don't for once think you're better than what I have
You're the reason I never trusted anyone
Just to forget wouldn't make me as happy as it would to hate.
Just to forgive is so much more than you are worth.
Think the time I spent well so do I
And you tore
My life apart
Single breath,
You could've cared less if I was dead
If I was dead
Just to forget wouldn't make me as happy as it would to hate.
Just to forgive is so much more than you are worth,
Worth.
You care so much about yourself that it makes me sick to think of you.
Do you think how much I lost for you?
