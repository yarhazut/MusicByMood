It's the start of a brand new day
And I'm struggling to stay awake
So I can just stumble outside
Losing hope and my whole life
I'm just scraping by
Hoping no one will notice me
Here I am again
Trying to give in
To another bitter end
I don't think it'd be wrong
To be alone tonight
Please make this all end
(And I'm watching the lights flow by)
Watching the cars pass
Thinking they won't last
Darkness clouds all of my windows
Darkness clouds all of my windows
Taking my last breath
Time flows out my chest
I have lost the will to be
I have lost the will to be
Here I am again
Trying to give in
To another bitter end
I don't think it'd be wrong
To be alone tonight
Please make this end
And I could of changed the world
With my accomplishments (2x)
Here I am again
Trying to give in
To another bitter end
I don't think it'd be wrong
To be alone tonight
Please make this end
And I could of changed the world
With my accomplishments (4x)
