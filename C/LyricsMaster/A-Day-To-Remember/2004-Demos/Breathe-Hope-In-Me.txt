I'm so afraid, I can't hold on this time
That's why I write, to let you know
Just what goes on
'Cause this is me, and everything I've dreamed
And you know that I can't just settle for anything
Just once more can we pretend that everything is okay
And that we are all happy
Breathe hope in me
I need you
I try so hard to make this work in my life
I still believe in you
Play that faster and maybe they will move to our sound
This is the way its supposed to be
Coming together, on the dance floor will
You light the scene
Sing along
This is your favorite song
And we'll play along
'Cause you're the reason I'm alive
Close your eyes
Sit back and relax, we'll be okay
Time and time again,
I'll pray you're looking back
By the wake
So here we, we are, again [x4]
Close your eyes
Sit back and relax, we'll be okay
Time and time again,
I do hope you come back
By the wake
Close your eyes
Sit back and relax, we'll be okay
Time and time again,
I'll pray you're looking back
By the wake
By the wake
Awake
By the wake
