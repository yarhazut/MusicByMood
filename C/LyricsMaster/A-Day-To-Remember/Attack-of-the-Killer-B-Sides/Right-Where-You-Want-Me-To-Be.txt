This is the first time in a long time
That I've felt like coming home for the holidays.
Everybody's rushing about
Why won't anybody hear me out?
My money's low
So instead I'll write you a song everyone will know
Everyone will know
So here it goes
Can you hear me?
I write so much and it makes me sick
That is all
About you
Lets drop everything
And not come back 'til next fall
Everyone knows that you've got me
Right where you want me to be.
I'm coming home for the bright lights
And the long nights
Driving around with your friends in your parents car.
We're the ones who made it out
We're the ones who they'll talk about
My money's low
So instead I'll write you a song everyone will know
Everyone will know
So here it goes
Can you hear me?
I write so much and it makes me sick
That is all
About you
Lets drop everything
And not come back 'til next fall
Everyone knows that you've got me
Right where you want me to be.
Looking back on what we've done this year
It was the best times
It was the worst times
But we built something here
Can you hear me?
I write so much and it makes me sick
That is all
About you
Lets drop everything
And not come back 'til next fall
Everyone knows that you've got me
Right where you want me to be.
Can you hear me? (can you hear me?)
I write so much and it makes me sick
That is all
About you
Lets drop everything (lets drop everything)
And not come back 'til next fall
Everyone knows that you've got me
Right where you want me to be.
