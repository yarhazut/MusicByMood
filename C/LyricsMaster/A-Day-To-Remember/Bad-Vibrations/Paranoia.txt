Go
Expect the worst of everyone I meet
Count the clock 'cause I can't fucking sleep
Shootin' pain like a heart attack
Call my friends, I might not make it back
The doctor says I'm headin' for destruction
Something's gotta give
I'm like a time bomb tickin' in your head
Paranoia cloudin' your judgment
And no matter what you do about it, 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm still in your head
I stop and stare, scared of the unknown
Unknown numbers been blowin' up my phone
I'm hearing footsteps outside of my house
I'm afraid someone's tryin' to take me out
The doctor says I'm headin' for destruction
Can I fuckin' live?
I'm like a time bomb tickin' in your head
Paranoia cloudin' your judgment
And no matter what you do about it, 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm like a time bomb tickin' in your head
Paranoia cloudin' your judgment
And no matter what you do about it, 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm still in your head
I'm still in your head
I'm still in your head
I am your breaking point
You can't run, you can't hide
I'll be there when you close your eyes at night
I'm always watchin' you
The doctor says I'm headin' for destruction
My time is wearin' thin
I'm like a time bomb tickin' in your head
Paranoia cloudin' your judgment
And no matter what you do about it, 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm like a time bomb tickin' in your head
Paranoia cloudin' your judgment 
(Your judgment)
And no matter what you do about it, 'bout it, 'bout it
I'm still in your head
