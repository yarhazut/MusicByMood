What a waste, I see you now and then
But mostly we pretend we're not more strangers than we're friends
Then we say what we need to say
To try and get away from the tension we create
Why can't we say the things, the things we wish we would?
Why can't we laugh the way, the way we know we should?
Fall under the weight of all the pressure that's misplaced
Flaws that I embrace
Everybody sees your head's hung low
They don't ask, they don't wanna know us
I'll be the one, I'll be your spark
I'll be your light led through the darkness
Everybody sees your head's hung low
They don't ask, they don't wanna know us
I'll be the one, I'll be your spark
I'll be your light led through the darkness
I get, I get
I get so misunderstood
Somethin' changed the way we interact
Now we can't get it back, another relic of the past 
(Relic of the past)
Makes ya think, did I ever know you at all?
Follow until I fall, vultures circling in the sun, the sun, the sun, the sun
Why can't we say the things, the things we wish we would?
Why can't we laugh the way, the way we know we should?
Fall under the weight of all the pressure that's misplaced
Flaws that I embrace
Everybody sees your head's hung low
They don't ask, they don't wanna know us
I'll be the one, I'll be your spark
I'll be your light led through the darkness
Everybody sees your head's hung low
They don't ask, they don't wanna know us
I'll be the one, I'll be your spark
I'll be your light led through the darkness
I get, I get
I get so misunderstood
You can't just avoid the issue
You shoulda learned from the things we've been through
You don't know what you have until it's lost
Till the hammer drops
Brace, fall, brace, fall
Brace, fall, brace, fall
Brace, fall, brace, fall
Brace, fall, brace, fall
Fall under the weight of all the pressure that's misplaced
Flaws that I embrace
Everybody sees your head's hung low
They don't ask, they don't wanna know us
I'll be the one, I'll be your spark
I'll be your light led through the darkness
Everybody sees your head's hung low
They don't ask, they don't wanna know us
I'll be the one, I'll be your spark
I'll be your light led through the darkness
I get, I get
I get so misunderstood
