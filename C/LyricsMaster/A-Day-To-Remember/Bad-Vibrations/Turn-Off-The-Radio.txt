Tu-tu-tu-turn off the radio
There's something missing, there's an anger
Livin' half the world away
I hope you listen for a person with perspective
That isn't always the same
No need to water it down right now
You play the victim but it's all a charade
Times they, they are a-changin'
Get your things in order or get out the way
And it goes on and on and on
Turn off the radio
Till they've got somethin' real to say
Turn off the radio
To clear my mind and let me think
I need an answer, I've got the questions
Can't anyone out there just relate?
Turn off the radio
Turn off the radio
There's a division in our culture
That we live with every day
We're just people eating people
Such a sick, sad world we live in today
All I know's I wanna be
Everything expected of me
So everyone, we can agree
Somebody out there understands me
And it goes on and on and on
Turn off the radio
Till they've got somethin' real to say
Turn off the radio
To clear my mind and let me think
I need an answer, I've got the questions
Can't anyone out there just relate?
Turn off the radio
Turn off the radio
Someone out there, if you're listening
We're the victims of our indifference
Tell us more without controlling
What we think with what you're showing
Turn off the radio
Till they've got somethin' real to say
Turn off the radio
To clear my mind and let me think
I need an answer, I've got the questions
Can't anyone out there just relate?
Turn off the radio
Turn off the radio
