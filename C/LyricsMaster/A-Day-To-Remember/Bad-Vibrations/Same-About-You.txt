I just felt a wave, an emotion
And right then I knew that everything had changed
A whole side of you that went missing's
Gone and all I'd thought of you is wrong
Gotta step away for perspective
Need to take a chance to clear my head
Don't wanna understand your position
Oughta wash my hands of you and run
Think I lost my nerve like I lost you
Held trapped by what we were
No, I'll never feel the same
Same about you, same about you
No, I'll never feel the same
Same about you, same about you
Spent time today reminiscing
Think I learned a lot about who we are
Couldn't diagnose your condition
But now I see the signs you left behind
Think I lost my nerve like I lost you
And the truth remains unheard
No, I'll never feel the same
Same about you, same about you
No, I'll never feel the same
Same about you, same about you
Some roads you can't come back from
When you extract truth from the lie
No, I'll never feel the same
Same about you, same about you
No, I'll never feel the same
Same about you, same about you
