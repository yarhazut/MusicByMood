Burn me alive
If you feel that's justified
Burn me alive
If you feel that's justified
Burn me alive
If you feel that's justified
I need more than faith
To see you on the other side, the other side
Can you hear me, the lowly one?
Do ya fear me, you righteous ones?
Bow down to all Earth's creation
Every man of every nation
Who's right and wrong at times like these?
Burn me alive
If you feel that's justified
I need more than faith
To see you on the other side, the other side
Can you hear me, the lowly one?
Do ya fear me, you righteous ones?
I believe in a life before death
That happiness and virtue coexist
And if you only believe to hedge the bet
You're gonna pay your debt
Burn me alive
If you feel that's justified
I need more than faith
To see you on the other side, the other side
The lowly ones need more than this
To see you on the other side, the other side
Burn me alive, feel nothing
Leave nothing, learn nothing
Then be on your way
Be on your way
Do ya fear me, you righteous ones?
Can you hear me?
The lowly one, the lowly one
The lowly ones
