I won't accept your fear, another stagnant year
I'm pro-American but anti-politician
They'll trade you a voice for an illusion of choice
Truth hits like a goddamn premonition
Inroads to the hangman's noose
We got a lot to lose, is this where you wanna be?
Exhumed, they're not through with you
Until you're left exposed, is this who you wanna be?
Take what's been given or have none
The only claim of the workers in song
Get back in line you've all been warned
"We was beat when we was born"
Inroads to the hangman's noose
We got a lot to lose, is this where you wanna be?
Exhumed, they're not through with you
Until you're left exposed, is this who you wanna be?
Is this who you wanna be?
Is this who you wanna be?
Like a shark that's combing the surface
We got a taste for blood
Don't believe what the pacifist tells you
No war, no peace
Don't believe what the pacifist tells you
No war, no peace
