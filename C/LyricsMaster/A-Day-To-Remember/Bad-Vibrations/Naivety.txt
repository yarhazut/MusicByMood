What I hate about gettin' older
Where's my naivety?
Wonder when I'm gonna get taller
Where's my naivety?
Thinkin' back when we were younger
All of the things we believed that we could do
Don't wanna live by fear of failure
Where's my naivety?
Somehow lost along the way
This is me, honestly, I've got no apologies
I'm done chasing things that don't belong to me
This is real, it's how I feel with one shoulder on the wheel
What I'm searchin' for grows further out of reach
What I hate about gettin' older
Where's my naivety?
Wonder what it's like not bein' sober
Where's my naivety?
Lookin' back when we were younger
Every mistake was a chance that we could take
Now I think I'm just gettin' colder
Where's my naivety?
It got lost along the way
This is me, honestly, I've got no apologies
I'm done chasing things that don't belong to me
This is real, it's how I feel with one shoulder on the wheel
What I'm searchin' for grows further out of reach
I swear you won't take me back
I don't care; that's all in my past
I'm waitin' for what's next
And I won't let it slip away
Get me through another day
This is me, honestly, I've got no apologies
I'm done chasing things that don't belong to me
This is real, it's how I feel with one shoulder on the wheel
What I'm searchin for grows further out of reach
What I hate about gettin' older
Where's my naivety?
Where's my naivety?
