I feel like a runaway
Seeing the light of day for the first time
I'm drawing the line
It's hard to care when you know it all
In slow motion I watch you fall
Like you're blind, thoughts poison the mind
I always bend when it comes to you
I think you'll change but you never do
You never do, I enable you
Let me down, let me down like only you know how
Shut me out, shut me out
Forgive and forget
Forgive and forget
Let me down, let me down like only you know how
Shut me out, shut me out
Forgive and forget
Forgive and forget
Wish that I could say this to your face
Somethin' different, somethin' brave
Wish I would but I never could
I feel you slowly pulling me in
I try to help but it's sink or swim
And you're a weight, there's comfort in pain
Let me down, let me down like only you know how
Shut me out, shut me out
Forgive and forget
Forgive and forget
Let me down, let me down like only you know how
Shut me out, shut me out
Forgive and forget
Forgive and forget
You've drained all the love I had
All I had for you
Yeah, you've drained all the love I had
All I had for you
All I had for you
Let me down, let me down like only you know how
Shut me out, shut me out
Forgive and forget
Forgive and forget
Let me down, let me down like only you know how
Shut me out, shut me out
Forgive and forget
Forgive and forget
