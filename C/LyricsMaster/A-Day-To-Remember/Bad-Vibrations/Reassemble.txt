I have come undone, desperate and out of touch
Fall when I should run, am I worth a reassemble?
I have come undone, this illness is my crutch
Call out to anyone, am I worth a reassemble?
I toss, turn beneath the waves
A silent victim of the depths
Cast aside, I'm scrambling to catch my
I can't find my way out as I'm descending
My path remains unclear as the water overtakes me
Drowning in my despair
I have come undone, desperate and out of touch
Fall when I should run, am I worth a reassemble?
I have come undone, this illness is my crutch
Call out to anyone, am I worth a reassemble?
My thoughts are not my own
Nowhere's safe alone in the tide
I'm alone and it sinks in
This current's pulling me under
Drowning in my despair
I have come undone, desperate and out of touch
Fall when I should run, am I worth a reassemble?
I have come undone, this illness is my crutch
Call out to anyone, am I worth a reassemble?
The surf's against us, are we able?
Forgive our faults when they're shameful
Let's be honest with ourselves
Worn and broken, reassembled
Forgive our thoughts when they're shameful
Let's be honest with ourselves
Let's be honest with ourselves
