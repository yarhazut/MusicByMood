Don't forget that this is a choice
Pick your poison, live with remorse
Don't forget that this is a choice
Pick your poison, live with remorse
I could burn a hole with my eyes
That cuts straight through the skin
No more love, no more resolution
It's getting harder bearin' the darkness within
I gotta let it out, I'm gonna let it
I can feel your bad vibrations
All around me, all consuming
Corrupting all that I am
This pain is a sickness
Looming over me and I can't escape it
Casting shadows that continue to shape
Who I am on any given day
It's like a fog surrounds me, applyin' pressure within
Weighing me down, seeing in double vision
It hits so hard I stu-stu-stutter my speech
Ya go kinda cold inside, dancing on thin ice
I can feel your bad vibrations
All around me, all consuming
Corrupting all that I am
This pain is a sickness
Looming over me and I can't escape it
Casting shadows that continue to shape
Who I am on any given day
This pain is a sickness
Looming over me and I can't escape it
Casting shadows that continue to shape
Who I am on any given day
Toxic
Toxic
Toxic
Toxic
This darkness, this darkness
Leaves me empty like I am the heartless
Toxic
Toxic within
