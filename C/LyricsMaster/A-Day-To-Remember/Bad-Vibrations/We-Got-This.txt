To anyone who's alone in a crowded room
Put your hands up high, sing it out of tune
It's these late night hours we spend that
Help me up from down
You're just like me when I was your age
We all knew better, name it; we've been there
When I had a place that I could call my own
We spent most days, countin' the ways
We would get through it but they said we're stupid
Now all those kids say they knew us so well
Come on, get real
To anyone who's alone in a crowded room
Put your hands up high, sing it out of tune
It's these late night hours we spend that
Help me up from down, we got this
I'm not afraid of anything
Here's to the future, it was nice that I knew ya
Go find somethin' that makes you feel complete
Till next time we meet
To anyone who's alone in a crowded room
Put your hands up high, sing it out of tune
It's these late night hours we spend that
Help me up from down, we got this
To anyone who's alone in a crowded room
Put your hands up high, sing it out of tune
It's these late night hours we spend that
Help me up from down, we got this
You're just like me when I was your age
Things do get better, trust me; I've been there
You're just like me when I was your age
Things do get better, trust me; I've been there
You're just like me when I was your age
Things do get better, trust me; I've been there
You're just like me when I was your age
Things do get better, trust me; I've been there
To anyone
To anyone
To anyone who's alone in a crowded room
Put your hands up high, sing it out of tune
It's these late night hours we spend that
Help me up from down, we got this
To anyone who's alone in a crowded room
Put your hands up high, sing it out of tune
It's these late night hours we spend that
Help me up from down, we got this
Yeah, we got this
