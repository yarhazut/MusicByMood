Let's go!
You said I couldn't make it,
But look at me now.
You said I would fail
You said I would fail
But look at me now.
(We'll never back down!)
We'll never back down!
(We'll never back down!)
We'll never back down
"I'm a lead farmer muthafucka!"
I am one man
This where I stand.
Yeah
This where I stand now
Nothing can bring me down
I'm on top of the world
WOO!
It's took me this long to prove you wrong,
But I will always stand strong.
This is your last chance
To be you what you want to be
To believe what you want to believe
So follow your dreams and just hold on
Just stand strong tonight.
And we will never fall
We'll make it through it all.
Just stand strong, stand strong tonight
We will never fall
We'll make it through it all.
Through it all.
We'll never back down.
