I got lost in my own mind
I could not see, I could not find
The answer to the question I can't leave behind
Well, I guess I'm just one of a kind
I'm so fed up with all these people who
Does nothing but shut up
Why don't you express yourselves and do what you feel?
- But what feels real?
There's so many colors around you
Why don't you use them and abuse them?
Another year, another time
Take a note and stand in line
The line to the new world where
I can't hear my own scream
Well, I guess it's just another lucid dream
