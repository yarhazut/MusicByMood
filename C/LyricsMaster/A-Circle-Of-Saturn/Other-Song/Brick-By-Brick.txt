I see the look in every man's eye
No sight of joy, no satisfied minds
I don't forget what you people have done
And I won't respect what side you're on
-"Don't blame me"
So, you're not a brick that built this great wall?
That even stopped me, when I felt small...
I tore it down, brick by brick
So get out of my way, little boy
You make me sick
I have been crying, and I wasted so many tears on you
But now I am smiling, 'cause I found my own way and made it through
Oh, now I remember how I used to be
I was blinded, I couldn't see
My eyes are wide open and my lips aren't sealed
Never took it for granted, my mind is healed
