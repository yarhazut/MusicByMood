Do you care about yourselves?
You never ever, gave us a chance
And all the magic we used to show
Is long time gone, we are where we belong
And that's what's keeping us strong
We're dreaming on
Well, dream along. Yeah
A Dreamers Song
I hope I never wake up
Follow me, and you will see
That I will be the one to make you happy
So watch us now
And take a bow
We don't care what you do 'cause we look better than you
So throw in the towel
And realize
That we are better and stronger
That's why we are going to last longer
