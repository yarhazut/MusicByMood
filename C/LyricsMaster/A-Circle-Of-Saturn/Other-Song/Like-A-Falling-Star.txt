How many people is really bad to the bone?
A departure for a riot that has never been shown
Monday morning is hear and I've got nothing to do
Just sitting around and wait for the sky to turn blue
Monday morning's gone the wait for Friday's to long
Wednesday beats me down but on Thursday I grow strong
If we ever fall, we're gonna' celebrate all night long
Like a falling star
The space remains
It stays the same
An empire was built for the space-age son
But all the walls will fall 'cause evolution must go on
A foresight of a human with a beautiful face
A bench of starlightplaying creatures
An entire different race
