I hope you see me when you're crying, on the floor with no remorse
You'll never sleep the same again, you'll see my face and remember when
The truth came out and the shard went in
I took your life and you let me live
One more kiss, one more night, one more long goodbye
Your pretty face, your painted nails, the darkest night, death prevails
And when you see my face, remember everything
And when I walk away, there's nothing left to say
Your eyes they tell me your secrets, and now my eyes they're filled with regrets
I know you're not one to forgive, if that's the case then move on and forget
Forget my name, forget this place
Forget my love, and forget my face
One more kiss, one more night, one more long goodbye
Your pretty face, your painted nails, the darkest night, death prevails
And when you see my face, remember everything
And when I walk away, there's nothing left to say
This is the last time that I'll see you and I'll miss you more than words
Could ever say, could you say
Hurry save me, hurry save me
