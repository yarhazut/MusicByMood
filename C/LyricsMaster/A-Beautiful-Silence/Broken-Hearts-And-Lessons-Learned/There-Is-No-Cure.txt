Words could never express, the way that I feel about this world 
A world that needs no introduction, because we already know 
We know too much, we hate for fun, it's getting out of hand, 
Hands that never seem to find each other. 
Hold your head, up high, tonight 
Take a stand, for what you know is right 
And I've seen this, I've seen this, too many times before. 
It seems that there is no cure, for the way people are 
The rapture is coming, their bodies reconstructing 
This is the second coming, a massive genocide 
For Christ he cries on horse he rides this is terrible. 
Hold your head, up high, tonight 
Take a stand, for what you know is right 
And I've seen this, I've seen this, too many times before.
