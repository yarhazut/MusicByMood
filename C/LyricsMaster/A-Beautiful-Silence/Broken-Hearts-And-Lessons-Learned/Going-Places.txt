So it's been said, that I won't make it on my own
But I know, that I'm going places that you'll never know
And one day you'll find me hiding, on your back porch
And I see through these lies, should I end it with this knife
I've seen the things you do, don't know what you've got to prove
Does this mean anything to you, does this mean anything to you
Now it's too late, for an apology, not it's too damn late for an apology.
And I see through these lies, should I end it with this knife
I've seen the things you do, don't know what you've got to prove
Does this mean anything to you, does this mean anything to you?
