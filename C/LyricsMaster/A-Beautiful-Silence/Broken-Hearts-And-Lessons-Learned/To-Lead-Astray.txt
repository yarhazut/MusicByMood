Know that you meant it when you told me that you love me, that your sorry you couldn't change, what happened in the past, you made a crucial mistake, if you could go back and change it you would, I know and it shows when those tears fall from your face.
Can we make it through the night I think ill give this one more try and after all the things we've been through I think we will survive and we'll strive to overcome this fear of being so dark and so lonely because without each other were nothing.
There aren't to many people that havent lied to me the deceit it burns a hole into my soul the hate that you cause it kill people it traumatizes them and these wounds they'll turn into scars and be there forever.
Can we make it through the night I think ill give this one more try and after all the things we've been through I think we will survive and we'll strive to overcome this fear of being so dark and so lonely because without each other were nothing.
