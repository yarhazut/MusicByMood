She enters the room so calm and composed, she's got one thing on her mind as she makes her approach, and her lipstick it glistens like the moonlight, and one kiss will bring you to your knees tonight.
Hello I know she's wasting your time, hello I know she's tearing out your spine, and if this keeps up you know shell destroy your mind and I'll be waiting
Now that she's got you right where she wants you, she'll take everything she's got nothing to prove, and her lipstick is stained across your collar, and one kiss you'll swear that you love her.
Hello I know she's wasting your time, hello I know she's tearing out your spine, and if this keeps up you know shell destroy your mind and I'll be waiting
