This January rain, takes away my pain, the subtle things that tear my body will always be the same, this city it kills me, I've lost all hope and dignity and the only thing that keeps me going is dreaming that I can be, anything I want, give all that I've got to be the person that I am the side I almost lost,
And when I woke up and saw the sunshine the tears streamed from my eyes it was all just a dream, it was all just a dream, and its clear to see, that there's nothing left for me, that there's nothing left for me here.
I'm swallowing my pride, this fear that's left inside, its convincing but I'm not convinced I have nothing to hide, I'm lying to myself keep asking the same questions, but questions without answers lead to nothing but exceptions.
And when I woke up and saw the sunshine the tears streamed from my eyes it was all just a dream, it was all just a dream, and its clear to see, that there's nothing left for me, that there's nothing left for me here.
No more broken promises, the tears that fell they won't be missed,
