There's no time to react, as the windshield cracks, it'll all be over soon 
It happened so quickly, with no reactivity, I know my time has come 
So let it go, and let it be, we all need someone right now 
Tell my friends, that I'll miss them, and I'm sorry I couldn't be there 
Tonight 
So it's December and the snow is falling faster then, you could ever catch it on your tongue 
Six months have passed since I've been gone, so now it's time for you to move on, and find somebody else 
So let it go, and let it be, we all need someone right now 
Tell my friends, that I'll miss them, and I'm sorry I couldn't be there 
Tonight 
Have you ever slowed down, to think about the consequences of your actions 
Can we turn back time and do it right this time, I'm sorry but death is part of life
