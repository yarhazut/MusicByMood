So humble and brave, you walk to the door
Expecting my face, you forget who you are
Your charming grace, keeps me coming back for more
Your eternal embrace, leaves me no other choice
I don't want you but I need you more, than ever
You're tearing my heart apart at the seems
You know me all too well
Take a look, take a long hard look at what you've done with this place
Now the whiskey runs dry, as it flows through my veins
To rinse away the painful things that you say
To try and erase all these pictures of your face
I don't want you but I need you more, than ever
You're tearing my heart apart at the seems
You know me all too well
Time goes by, crimson butterflies
They break me down, every time
