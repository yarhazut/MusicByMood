So you're the one playing favorites this time
I'm not the one lingers in your mind
I'm just a pawn in this game you play
I think it's safe to say
If I should die tonight would you be surprised
Would you fall to your knees would you start to cry
I'm standing tall but I fall so fast
I'm losing touch this will never last
The ghosts of your victims the things that you did to them
Now the time has come to let you in on their fate
You can make this so much easier
Put the pieces together
You can't live forever
