Letra De You're Living A Lie
Am I alive or am I just a lie that you have conjured up in your mind 
Can I have your soul it's a simple yes or no 
I think we both know how this story goes 
I can save this one song for you I can promise you this 
It hurts me to breathe you've got me shaking at my knees 
Trying to make it on my own is proving harder than you will ever know 
So lock me up tie me down strip me of everything 
That I once had and everything that I have known 
So lock me up and tie me down and leave me here to die 
And as I decay throw my body in the flames and let me burn 
It's taken me so damn long to pick up the pieces and just move on 
I'm confident that I'm not losing sleep
