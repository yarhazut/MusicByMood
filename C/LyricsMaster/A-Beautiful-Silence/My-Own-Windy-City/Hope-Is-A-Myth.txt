The words you're about to hear
Tell a tale that's all too clear
Based on true events
This story ends with you
We wait for something hopeful
If memories could tell lies
Then all our wrongs would be rights
And we'd bet our lives
On Games that we should stay away
Now I could sit here and watch you go by
Like the stars in the sky you shine so bright
The temperature is rising but hey it's surprising that we met
So you just wait and see
The things you do to me
I won't let you fall
