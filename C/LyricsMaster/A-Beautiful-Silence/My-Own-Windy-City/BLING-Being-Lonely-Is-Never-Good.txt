Another minute goes by
I stand here yeah I'm living this lie
Watching the clock as the angels rise
I don't want this dirty money
I won't take part in spreading envy
To find what greed is just follow the dirty paper trail
Hate spreads so rapidly
But I hold on to this catastrophe
I can't shake what wont bury me
I won't forget this tragedy
We're not who we think we are
