You pay for the things you have with kisses you stole from me 
This conversation is breaking me 
I won't let you go for anything 
I'll put on my happy face pretend everything will be ok 
You substitute me for the next best thing I'll always be your next best thing 
I won't let you go for anything 
You'll be the death of me in time I'll let you know 
Your eyes are the reason my heart is beating 
Your smiles the reason that I keep breathing 
Your love is the reason that I keep screaming out
