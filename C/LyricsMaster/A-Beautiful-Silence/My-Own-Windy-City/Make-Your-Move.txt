You know that I've got my eyes on you 
I have for a while not don't be scared 
I've got nothing but good intentions 
O did I mention I'm for real 
Now press your lips against mine 
I don't mine 
Place your hands on my face 
To embrace 
Live in the moment before you know it 
It's done 
There's only one first and there's only one last 
And it's time 
To make your move I adore you and you know it don't you? 
Don't you tell me your not ready to take this chance 
And lets say that you were to die tonight 
My whole world would be turned upside down and inside out 
Now I've got myself in a situation that calls for attention 
But I've got no worries those things they call worries they don't exist 
I take my time I've got nine lives and I've died only twice 
For a limited time only nine ninety nine ill sell you my soul
