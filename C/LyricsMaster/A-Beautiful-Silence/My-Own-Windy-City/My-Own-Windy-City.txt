As I walk down these lonely streets again 
I learn that nothing is holy except the rest of the world 
And the church where they gather to worship the undead 
In a place that gives all hope but hope is not real 
Always remember that and take for granted 
Everything you can this is your only lonely life 
In my own windy city I would take the hearts of all the pretty 
People who have no soul just an empty hole 
Where they bleed from their chest 
Now all these tall buildings fall 
They surround our country with security 
If it takes four years to bring down our fears 
Our government will give three cheers
