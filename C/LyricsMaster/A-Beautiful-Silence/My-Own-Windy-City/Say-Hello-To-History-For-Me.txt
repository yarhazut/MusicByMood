Ignorance is bliss and so commonly linked to our memories
When hope becomes just a word that has no meaning anymore
When there's nothing left to hope for
History has a tendency of repeating
Confidence has a consequence and it's pushing
Me over the edge and I've been thinking that this will never end
I've got the confidence to do this but something is holding me back
So I'll say my prayers
Hold my breathe
Cross my heart
Set my mind free
Feelings keep building never release me
From these hollow walls that are built and fall around me
When life becomes just a thing that ends before it begins
And our children slit their wrists beneath our parkways
I won't forget who I am because this is where I find compassion
I won't forget who I am and every day I keep on wishing
