Today we're breaking up tonight we're making love our hands our shaking now 
Today your nothing lost tonight you're all I've got I've missed you more 
But you stay away because you hear I'm bad 
But you stay away because you hear I'm sad 
I've got something I just need to tell you 
Today I walk alone tonight I'll walk you home our hands are tied 
Today I'm one lost soul tonight are souls are whole makes perfect sense 
But I stay away because I hear you're bad 
But I stay away because I hear you're sad
