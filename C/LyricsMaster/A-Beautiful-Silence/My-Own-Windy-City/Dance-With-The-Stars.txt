Your exterior is hard and fast while your interior will never last
The poisonous venom that flows in your veins spikes the addiction that I know you crave
The noxious gases that you inhale destroy your brain cells and they make you pale
So take this advice and clean up your act start paying your dues
Learn to love and respect the thing you have
I'll admit that I'm afraid of dying but a life worth living is a life that's worth fighting for
So I'll take my chances and I'll let you know
That I'm not that easy I'm the one in control
Now how does that sit with you does it hit close to home
Does it make you shake and lose control
Now take your time getting over
The fact that your dead and you'll never be sober
So do another line pretend you can fly
Leave through the window I can't watch you die
So tell me again what goes through your head
Nothing at all is what she said
Now she's kind of clueless to the things that she's done
The places she's been
Her infamous run with the devil's men
Now I know that you haven't had the best life
But you also haven't had the worst life
And to sit here and watch you die slowly but surely
It tears me apart it tears us all apart
Now there's nothing you can do and I realize that
But there is something that you can do
May the wind be at your back and the sun upon your face
And may the winds of destiny carry you aloft
To dance with the stars
