Awaiting here in silence, seems so far away 
I've tried to stop this burden, but it breaks again 
Can't control this thoughts I cannot 
Loose my sanity or I'll fail 
I have to stop running away from my self 
Or I'll end away from thee 
I need to cure what's deep in me 
Take my eyes... 
The reason seems so fair 
...Thus far 
This bitter drink we taste, 
What make us hide away... in the dark 
So see what's deep inside 
And take good care 
This awful drink we take, 
What makes us fade away... in the night 
So you'll face the reason, the choice that 
You made a contradiction 
You ask for perfection, I ask for my self 
You have to learn from the flame 
You have within 
And try to use it well
