She doesn't know how 
She doesn't know where she's going to end 
In this back seat of leather 
All she sees are trees that are passing her by 
To reach an end 
In this place 
That seems a duel with time 
In the end the distance calms 
The memories 
There are deaths that cannot save 
There are pains that cannot heal 
She doesn't know why 
She doesn't know where she's going to end 
In this train to nowhere 
All she sees are fields with her last memories 
To reach the end 
In a day 
That crawls against the time 
In the end what matters is to escape 
From emptiness 
Memories of her shattered soul 
In the end it's a train to nowhere 
All that's left just keeps you bounded 
You cannot go before the mourn 
In the end the distance calms 
The memories 
There are deaths that cannot save 
There are pains that cannot heal
