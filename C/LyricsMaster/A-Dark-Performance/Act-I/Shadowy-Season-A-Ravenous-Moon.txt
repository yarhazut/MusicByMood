The night is proclaiming, she owns all the beings
That torments your soul, you won't escape now
Bloodthirsty she looks for, and searches for a lost soul now...
You won't escape the shadows
Alliance, alliance of the mistress of the night
And all your fears now
Gets real the imaginations will come true
So they'll posses your feeble mind
No!
They're hearts ache!
Look away or the blaze will freeze you
The bodies in agony and pain convulse
Look away or she will spell you
And in the end you will be one more stone
'Cause she'll leave you cold and soulless
Look away or she will keep your life
