The sorrow just went away 
The coldness started to end 
The things just get clearer 
They do not posses me 
A concept that makes us through 
Is a progress that terminates 
And determinates us too 
The idea itself proclaims 
Proclaim now your position 
Or you will get lost 
Don't escape now to the reason 
That makes us fall 
But now I'll have to show you my strength, or keep it hidden 
Right now I see clear you through my mind, I seem to follow 
This state of mind is pulling me down, it controls me now 
I know the only way out to this is facing my demons 
The maze helps me proclaim 
The pain slowly fades away 
The maze is my own mind 
That will release me to my own hell 
And makes us fall 
So I'll show you my strength
