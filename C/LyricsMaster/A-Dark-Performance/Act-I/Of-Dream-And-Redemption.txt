The ghosts do not destroy the memory
They feed it from the corner of this dark room
The memories of his life
The only thing that has some value
NOW!
Feel in the air the joy of past times
Just hold the corpses of those who are gone slow
The bodies they found some protection
Redemption, they fill up with the forces that
Brings them some heat that has never been felt
(In every inch of their bodies)
Feel in your body the force and power
That emanates from their rotten skins
Their thoughts corrupted, their omnius presence
Fell for the first time their last moments
