Standing in this painting, that it seems to be alive 
It's black but has some contrasts I can barely see it all 
Don't wake me up, is this a dream? 
Don't know anymore what's real or not 
The painting is real, the crows start to move now 
But at the same time everything is paper and watercolor 
Don't know what they're doing 
They're coming in my direction 
I take the soil and cover as a blanket 
But made of wood paper and I 
Try to hide from them now 
They stop besides me they know 
I'm there now... 
They start to look at me 
And I see their ignis fatuous so clear 
This imagery is real and I know 
At the same time that it is just a dream
