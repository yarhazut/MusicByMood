There was a time when darkness and light
Collide in a battle to decide who would have the power
To rule all the fire is the main task for each side
And since then they have struggled
Until one day...
The time has come
The fire will tear it down
Look how it tries to escape
This will exterminate it all
Here comes the fire!
Ask for no conditions or it will burns us faster
And in the darkness!
We'll have to use our power to annihilate our conscience
There goes the fire!
And now through the fire
A new world order has risen
And those who oppose it will
Eternally burn
They will burn
