Welcome home, (welcome home)
It's been such a long time, such a long time darlin'
Welcome home, (welcome home)
It's been such a long time, such a long time comin'
These street signs were boundaries
These street lights called out your name and killed me
This Distance grew greater even though you were inches away
You couldn't even hear me scream your name
(HEY!) were back in business now after a long time away
(HEY!) were back in business now after a long time away
No never let this go (let this go)
You'll never be alone
And you know it's true
No never let this go (let this go)
Cause this is home
And you know it's true
That you were the best thing about this part of town
And we're glad you're back
My dance card was empty until you came around
Now we're used to the sound
Let's act like we own the summer
Let's get down
Show em' how we get down
(It's the summer heat.
It's the summer heat,
It's the summer heat
Beneath our feet
Let's get down
Show em' how we get down)
