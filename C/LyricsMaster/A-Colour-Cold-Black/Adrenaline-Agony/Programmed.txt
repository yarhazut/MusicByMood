No one can see my programmed brain
No one knows that I kill but I don't feel
Follow my aim till it is erased
Target destroyed-mission is completed
I am programmed to kill
No chance for my victim to escape
Terminating life aim after aim
View straight ahead-show no mercy show no tears
Emptiness in my eyes-pull the trigger down
Target destroyed-mission is completed
I am programmed
Programmed to kill-target destroyed-mission is completed
I lighten the hills
The red and the blue
I hunger for skills
And am programmed for you
