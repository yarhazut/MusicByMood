Something special's in the air 
We'll be-come historical 
Merchandising superstition 
A magic figure 
We'll all be one 
A wonder to the sun 
Y2k is here 
Thank god for his son 
And they flew far away 
Kneedeep in dust 
As they walked upon the clouds 
They looked above 
And the twinkling bends of the rainbow 
Lightened the horizon 
When the rain poured down 
They felt so warm together 
When the lightnings blew 
They felt so warm together 
Is it fate or not? 
Is it luck what we'll share? 
Is it anything at all 
Or is our spine aware? 
No, this isn't truth 
What would you call it anyway?
