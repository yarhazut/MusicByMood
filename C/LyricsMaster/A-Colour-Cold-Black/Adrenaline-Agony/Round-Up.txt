Fear-as I look over my shoulder 
The stars above seem home, but this night 
I don't think of it to be any closer than up there 
Now and then I feel so goddam weak 
Standing firm I realize nothing's a shadow anymore 
Looking it straight in the eye! 
Don't you feel that paralyzing pressure on your brain? 
But what we are shouldn't feel like creeping fear 
Burned out to be a really open mind 
For what they say and tell it forth 
You might say "I believe in what I see" 
But let me guess-you just see what you believe! 
And after closing your eyes you still 
Feel the dark shadows hanging recklessly! 
Let's all round up under the gods! 
Let's all round up under the gods of 
Fear and lies and dark tales of hate and 
Greed and envious black men! 
The fear of losing this or changing anything 
Implantated-circulating in your veins! 
The fear of expanding your imagination 
Implantated-circulating in your veins! 
You might say "I believe in what I see" 
But let me guess-you just see what you believe! 
And after closing your eyes you still 
Feel dark shadows hanging recklessly! 
Let's all round up under the gods...
