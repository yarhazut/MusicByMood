The fear, the lies-the cruelty 
The glory, the tales-the jealousy 
Insanities-the morphine 
Things to adore-crumble to dust 
Within the hype-you call your name 
And then I feel-the nihil 
The fear, the lies-the cruelty 
The glory, the tales-the jealousy 
Insanities-the morphine 
I feel like one of a million 
I feel like I'm all alone 
The moral of the story turns to misinterpretation 
Dismember the values into what you feel 
So never, so cynical 
The only truth is nothing 
I don't believe you dreaming 
And I'll wipe it all away 
Dismember the values into what you feel 
Blue, pale, blind 
I sure don't mind to spoil it 
Waste what you find 
I'll be your downer 
The corroder 
I leave nothing behind 
I refuse to swallow the hollow
