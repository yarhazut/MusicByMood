The drowning sun 
Red light shines 
Foresee the storm 
All lights go out 
The time stands still 
A blowing fire on earth 
Unsympathetic my view 
I am doomed to die 
Increase my belief in life and 
I suffer in truth 
Burning bodies melt together in red flesh 
Erasing life 
Black infected wounds 
The dirty blood clots 
Unsympathetic my view 
I am doomed to die 
Increase my belief in life 
I suffer in truth 
No longer life in a contaminated air 
The time stands still 
A blowing fire on earth 
No longer life in a contaminated air
