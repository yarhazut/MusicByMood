Intoxicated world 
Shifting by the neon light 
Don't look to the ground 
Crying out our madness face to face 
Is it fact or fiction-game or gust 
Roaring in our ears 
Roaring through whatever counts 
Which always hurts 
Never knew but dark to us 
We dream on-informations overcome 
Is it squandermania? 
If reality not equals truth 
Go on-call me a liar 
In and out-beyond truth 
High so high-in stinking bloom 
In toxication of 
Your spirit and your body drunken spine 
Amorph metamorphosis 
Adrenaline agony in vein 
I light another cigarette 
Sucking out what it's gotta give me 
That screen runs my brain 
That crying last night felt like bleeding or puking 
Deep inside I feel I've got to hold on to something 
If reality not equals truth 
Go on-call me a liar 
In and out-beyond truth 
High so high-in stinking bloom
