Wide awake (left alone in the crowd) 
Blind for you (I'm making my steps) 
No, I could never be a slave (to the gore rhythm) 
I beat the bloody drum myself (always watching my back) 
Yeah, I'm an angel 
I'm playing games 
Innocent like children 
Crushing the pale 
Bubbles of illusion 
Against those who won't play 
Life to me (flashing motorways) 
No turnarounds (takeover at right) 
What do you call a human being (to be is to have) 
If there's nothing what you can't grap (I will be something)
