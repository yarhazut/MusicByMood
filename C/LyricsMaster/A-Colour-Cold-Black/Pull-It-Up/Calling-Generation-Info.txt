Burn out, burn out 
The voices you hear are not from the radio 
Turn around, around 
And check if what you hear switches in the stereo 
Can you tell if the universe really spins like they say? 
Everyday till the sun goes down you think you're watching it all return 
Choose, chose, chosen 
Do you really fit your local chain store? 
Look out, lock in 
Compare the stars to the pixels on your monitor 
Do you know why the universe looks so plain black and white? 
The information overdose would kill you right away 
You can tell you wanna be a machine 
You can tell you wanna be a child 
So don't watch your steps tonight - be free 
Thinking innocent 
I'll be your pillow now, your host 
Think innocent 
Let go, go, go 
Do miracles originate from the video? 
No, no, oh, no 
The video breeds it again, I tell you so 
Do you know that the universe is exploding ever since? 
Don't you feel like you and it all are exploding every day? 
You can tell you wanna be a machine 
You can tell you wanna be a child 
So don't watch your steps tonight - be free 
Thinking innocent 
I'll be your pillow now, your host 
Think innocent
