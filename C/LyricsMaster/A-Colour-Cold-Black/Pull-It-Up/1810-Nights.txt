Divide the day 
In rhythms and shades 
How can you be so far away, huh? 
You're so far away 
I feel oh so mortal without you baby 
How can you be so far away, huh? 
You're so far away 
Dare not to ask what's worth the way, so 
How can you be so far away? 
In a sudden break I had to let go 
My name is unknown 
Where only the past is real 
I know you still 
How can you be so far away? 
How can you be so far away? 
You're so far away 
You're so far away 
Drifting apart 
The more minutes the more I say 
How can you be so far away? 
Have I had a chance? 
Look into my eyes 
How can you be so far away, huh? 
You're so far away 
In a sudden break I had to let go 
My name is unknown 
Where only the past is real 
I know you still 
How can you be so far away? 
How can you be so far away? 
How can you be so far away? 
How can you be so far away?
