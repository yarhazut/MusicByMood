I'm wearing you deep inside like a cancer 
I know nothing can save me 
I'm wearing you deep inside like a cancer 
I know nothing can save me 
Alone on our funeral - Staring straight 
Lots of preachers tell me what to wait for 
It all to fade 
I'm a believer (I'm oh so blue) 
In nothing ever felt as strong as you, no 
In love and hurt 
I'm wearing you deep inside like a cancer 
I know nothing can save me 
I'm wearing you deep inside like a cancer 
I know nothing can save me 
As I've been taking the pain I really lived all those nights 
I know nothing can break me 
Nothing can break me 
Blame it on a feeling 
I blame it on the moon 
I blame it on the miles that yet don't lie between me 
And the corners we striped 
I'm wearing you deep inside like a cancer 
I know nothing can save me 
I'm wearing you deep inside like a cancer 
I know nothing can save me 
As I've been taking the pain I really lived all those nights 
I know nothing can break me 
Nothing can break me
