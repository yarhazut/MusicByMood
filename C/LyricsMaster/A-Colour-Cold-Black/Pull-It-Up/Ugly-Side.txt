Try to face yourself inside 
And make sure you've really found 
So what do you see, what tears you down? 
You've got to try to filter it out of you 
Don't try to hide, no 
Just free yourself from parasites 
Kill the beast 
And you will cause no tears no more 
I have found my ugly side 
But it's hard to make it change 
Once in your life you've got to bleed 
To feel joy in waiting for the light 
Don't try to hide, no 
Just free yourself from parasites 
Turn off the sun 
You gotta drink the sea and eat the land 
Don't try to hide, no 
Just free yourself from parasites 
Turn off the sun 
Stop the time and still your ugly side remains
