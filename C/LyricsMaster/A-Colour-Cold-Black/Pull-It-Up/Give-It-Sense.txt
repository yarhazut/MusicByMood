Again I wonder how to give 
-How to give it sense 
You would not have let this become 
-Let this become true 
So I just can't believe in you 
-Can't believe in you 
There are so many reasons for you to 
-Step in here right now 
When life turns black - I still will 
Find one little light 
For I have learned there is no Spring without fall 
Yeah, anytime I will die and cause 
You tears 
But, now nothing can make me 
Give up myself 
Do you like to watch it from above? 
-Watch it from above 
Do you like to see the weak bleeding? 
-See the weak bleeding 
No end in sight in this endless night 
-In this endless night 
I guess our spirit will not rise 
-Will not rise again 
When life turns black - I still will 
Find one little light 
For I have learned there is no Spring without fall 
Yeah, anytime I will die and cause 
You tears 
But, now nothing can make me 
Give up myself
