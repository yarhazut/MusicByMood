Under the sky of liquid blue 
I searched for something new 
All that I found were lifeless streams 
And nothing that responds at all 
I found myself shattered and naked under the cold sun 
Could not find comfort down here 
I slept for too long and then I woke up 
Reality is that cruel and bad 
Under the sky with you 
Trying to find shelter in you 
Innocent eyes of the sky 
Were looking down at me 
"Justice is my friend, don't blame me at all, 
You just get what you deserve." 
Under the sky with you 
Trying to find shelter in you
