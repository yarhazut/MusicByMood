Heard of a masterplan 
Heard how long it takes to get there 
I won't wait, hesitate, I'll make my life go faster 
I learned to regret 
Learned to take it all back 
Start again, one-way-train, I like to feel the wind blow 
Pull it up 
Fill the void 
I am going on the water 
Pull it up 
Cause life's a bitch you know 
I need money, come on! 
Scripting my own life 
I dedicated myself to thrillers lately 
Overdose, thunder, lightning, just to mention a few 
Playing every role 
On the hills, down the water 
Is it a nightmare going so deep letting me sleep? 
Pull it up 
Fill the void 
I am going on the water 
Pull it up 
Cause life's a bitch you know 
I need money, come on!
