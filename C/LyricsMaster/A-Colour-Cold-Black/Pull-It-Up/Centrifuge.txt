On the meridian of time 
There is no injustice 
There is only the poetry of motion 
Creating the illusion of truth and drama 
At 23 I feel like burning 
At half mast my flag within time 
All of you crap you keep on turning 
At half mast my flag within time 
Osmosis there still is 
And here and there articulation 
But at the periphery the veins are varicose 
And the sun bleeds like a broken rectum 
At 23 I feel like burning 
At half mast my flag within time 
All of you crap you keep on turning 
At half mast my flag within time 
And the light waves bend 
At 23 I feel like burning 
At half mast my flag within time 
All of you crap you keep on turning 
At half mast my flag within time
