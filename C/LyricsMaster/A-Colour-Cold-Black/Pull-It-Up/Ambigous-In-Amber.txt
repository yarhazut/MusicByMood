I am filthy rich, just like everyone around 
Calm down 
When we hear ourselves cry, 
We're turning up the sound, aha! 
I am special like the sunshine and the rain 
I'm hot, I'm cold 
I am anyone out of everyone 
Dive! Yeah! 
I'm empty, yet so filled up 
It seems our flow is stuck 
Inside of amber a million years 
I hate to be stuck here with you 
Her face looks like a promise 
I'm wading in her hair ... so deep 
Something in her eyes makes me remind of that despair 
So low, yeah 
I'm empty, yet so filled up 
I'm done - too young to die 
It seems our flow is stuck 
Inside of amber a million years 
I hate to be stuck here with you and 
Ying Yang 
Bang Bang 
Daily breaking inside
