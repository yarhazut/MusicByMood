I close my eyes and 
I see our flame burning so bright 
I forgot the feeling 
Awoken by your spirit 
That is streaming through my mind 
Salvation of my 
Soul, I am 
Fading away all alone 
Our flame is converting 
Into hellfire 
A slugging cry inside 
Is paralyzing me 
Infinity is growing 'cause I am 
Torn, pain is floating me 
Away 
Realizing so late that 
You can make my life complete 
My life complete 
You rule my dreams so 
At least I can see your face 
Half of the day 
Although it is not for real 
It helps me to go on 
Salvation of my Soul, 
Unbroken hope is all what remains 
'Cause Everything's not lost 
I am bearing too much drive 
Inside to make it end 
You are salvation of my soul 
Infinity is growing 'cause I am 
Torn, pain is floating me 
Away 
Realizing so late that 
You can make my life complete 
My life complete
