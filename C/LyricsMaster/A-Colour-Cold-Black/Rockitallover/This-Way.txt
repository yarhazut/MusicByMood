Now and then I see you doing it again
You try to smile politely but it feels so goddamn cold
Consuming your voice like a lullaby's sound
I rather do without to know how many times I was wrong, yeah
As long as you go on this way
Deep under your skin I claimed
For your soul
All that I found was a mystery
That took my faith away
This one will remain
It's no use
Sowing the seed without rain
As long as you go on this way
Do not fool me only for being kind
Show me your true aversion for me, don't feed me with lies
I'm tangled in that emotional disease
It's just because you are dazing me with that sweet lullaby's sound
As long as you go on this way
Deep under your skin I claimed
For your soul
All that I found was a mystery
That took my faith away
This one will remain
It's no use
Sowing the seed without rain
As long as you go on this way
