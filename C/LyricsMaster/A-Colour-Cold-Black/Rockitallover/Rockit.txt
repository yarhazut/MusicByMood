Oh lord 
I'm a detesting one 
For we all got our ass 
Wide open, wide open, yes 
Yeah we are really fucked up 
And there's no more to stay 
But rock it if you can 
All over, all over, yes 
A colour cold... 
I'm not begging the moment 
A colour cold... 
I'm rocking myself 
A colour cold Black 
Oh sure 
I'm a part of you 
And you are a part of me 
We are part of the whole, 
Part of the whole, yes 
A colour cold... 
I'm not begging the moment 
A colour cold... 
I'm rocking myself 
A colour cold Black
