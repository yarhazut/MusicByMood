Inside of your thoughts 
Swimming like nowhere else 
Your blood runs warm and I will feel if it turns cold 
Your smile: made for me, 
My life: created by your smile 
Losing the ground whenever you are living me 
Don't feel alone 'cause I am ready to 
Don't feel alone 'cause I am ready to burn with you 
Sleep like a stone for it feels better to turn with you 
Don't feel alone 'cause I am ready to burn with you 
Binding: the look of your eyes 
Then flying like nowhere else 
Enjoy and hope it to be forever 
I will burn with you 
The sweetest common sky 
I'll cry your tears whenever you bleed cold 
Don't feel alone 'cause I am ready to 
Don't feel alone 'cause I am ready to burn with you 
Sleep like a stone for it feels better to turn with you 
Don't feel alone 'cause I am ready to burn with you 
Driven into deepest trust - sleep like a stone 
Given no need or must - sleep like a stone 
Don't feel alone 'cause I am ready to 
Don't feel alone 'cause I am ready to burn with you 
Sleep like a stone for it feels better to turn with you 
Don't feel alone 'cause I am ready to burn with you
