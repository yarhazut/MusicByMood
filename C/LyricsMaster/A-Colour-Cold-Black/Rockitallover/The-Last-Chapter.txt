We will be gone too far,
Having forgotten how to live without
Modern electronic technology
Mortal metal makes me moan about my future
Reading the book of mankind
I rather want to stop 'cause I fear the truth
Now I turn the page, it's getting colder
Because it is...
The last chapter
The last chapter
And I try to regain only a little of what is
Lost, of what I loved to have
The machine swallows me, I try to keep
Away but it will get me
Is it facade?
Is it a mask?
I am looking for any face behind:
Pesonality or individuality
We are a crowd but still
Everyone of us: completely alone, like in a dream
Nobody sees me, nobody hears me
In...
The last chapter
The last chapter
And I try to regain only a little of what is
Lost, of what I loved to have
The machine swallows me, I try to keep
Away but it will get me
