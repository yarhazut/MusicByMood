Just blood and bones won't make my body 
Go out and cry... 
Pray, my baby pray, for my soul 
Rotting away 
I'm diving into blue 
Right down the things we do 
For each day is a rape 
I'll drug myself away 
If only my soul could love my body 
Forever more 
I'm diving into blue 
Right down the things we do 
For each day is a rape 
I'll drug myself away 
I run away 
From trust and believe 
That slipped through my hands 
Like grain of sands 
Craving for strength 
I dig into myself 
Ticking I find 
A timebomb of madness 
Rise, oh my soul 
Flee this stinking body, this goddamn world 
If only my soul could love my body 
Forever more 
I'm diving into blue 
Right down the things we do 
For each day is a rape 
I'll drug myself away 
I run away 
From trust and believe 
That slipped through my hands 
Like grain of sands 
Craving for strength 
I dig into myself 
Ticking I find 
A timebomb of madness
