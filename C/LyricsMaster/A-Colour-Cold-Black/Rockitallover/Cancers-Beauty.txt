The drowner's claw above yeah 
And still filled with beauty 
Drained into deepest spheres yeah 
Is where it all will be 
The dying sun warms my skin 
The bloody sky warms my eyes 
I'm rising in this demise 
This spreading cancer blooms for me 
Full of sense is our fate 
Cause our seed is grown 
Each little mistake wants to be erased 
Come-on-erase-us-all! 
The dying sun warms my skin 
The bloody sky warms my eyes 
You silly plug, drown with me 
Enjoy the twisted irony 
Everything dies for you 
Learn how to feel like me 
Red bloody sky - shining so warm for me 
We lose control - we never had it anyway 
Beautyful demise - I am your slave, ouh yes I'm 
Crying souls - of those who fight the fate 
The dying sun warms my skin 
The bloody sky warms my eyes 
Partly erased, it feels so numb 
Plastered by indifference 
Love has lost your eyes 
Searching a light in my world
