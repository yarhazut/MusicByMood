Break through the rain, the falling sky brings forth the day,
Where is are is now, and the falling sky reveals my fate.
Come on down, say your prayers and the light will show us all. Just when will this nightmare learn to fade? That's right I'm going to the city of clouds.
Guilt shines through my eyes, I can't stay.
Eyes look away as we'll fall into the night, only time will tell and your lies will follow through.
And this the night it will all fall down, your fading from me.
My hands shaking while this visions breaking.
Don't wait for me, wait for me.
Days turns night as night turns day.
Broken as we fall, the light will save us all.
Its hanging from the tree around my neck,
And I can't breath anymore, this is me as I fade.
I'm watching your dreams dying by the touch of my hand,
The story ending much too fast.
If there's no way we'll find one, but where do we go from here?
Break through the rain, the falling sky brings forth the day,
Where we are is now. the falling sky reveals my fate.
And this is the night it will all fall down, your fading you fade from me.
My hands shaking while this vision's breaking.
Don't wait for me. wait for me
