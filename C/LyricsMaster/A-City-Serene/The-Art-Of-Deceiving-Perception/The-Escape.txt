And the lights they fade
Behind us now
There is no time
To be ran out
So breathe in deep and
Scream so loud
They can't keep up
Can't reach us now
The bandages held deep within our hearts
Hide the pain we truly feel
Have I not spoken clearly
This love just rips right through me
And if we fall then we'll bleed together
Your voice sends chills up and down my spine
I see only you and that's just fine
And the lights they fade
Behind us now
There is no time
To be ran out
So breathe in deep and
Scream so loud
They can't keep up
Can't reach us now
In this world so bitter and cold
Our realitys so hard to unfold
And if we fall then we'll bleed together
Your face painted so clearly inside my mind
I refuse to catch my breath this time
And the lights they fade
Behind us now
There is no time
To be ran out
So breathe in deep and
Scream so loud
They can't keep up
Can't reach us now
Ships at the bottom of the ocean
Theyre sinking faster than they told us
This is our fate, it's our escape
Ships at the bottom of the ocean
My eyes wide open
You broke the silence
And brought the darkness
To end our dreaming now
And the lights they fade
Behind us now
There is no time
To be ran out
So breathe in deep and
Scream so loud
They can't keep up
Can't reach us now
