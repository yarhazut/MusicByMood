I need your smile
Not your frown
I need this light
This pause of sound
But something could change
Something could mend
This perfect daylight may end
I need this wind and your hair unwound
Our time of silence has left me unsound
If we've developed into friends
May God make our beginnings meet our ends
If I could explain what's in my head
If I could say what's been left unsaid
If you could forgive me
Let things mend
Our time of silence could end
