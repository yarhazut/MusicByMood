Today the clouds overhead
Were the unmade sheets
Of an upstairs bed
The open windows blew
They drifted to the sky,
The floor and I
Left lights on and an open door
And all the flights delayed
By the coming rain
Left empty contrails that blew away
And the jet set to take you circled above their cover
So we stand off the airfield
I in my t-shirt and you in my coat
And here beneath the rain
Soaked to the skin, we begin
And nights spent here with others before you came
Are remembered just the same
To place these lips between bleary eyes
A Judas kiss, and honest answer to my lies
I will fly my ship beneath the crossed and bleary skies
To find the orphan there, and hold him when he cries
