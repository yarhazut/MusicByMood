What once was
A landscape in flux
Is now conserved
By a green man
And a metal sign
The outer banks are alone
And Jersey waits
'Cause this afternoon
The outer banks had company
Two, 'cause three's a crowd
And in your company
I, like this tidal beach
Fear the public eye
So on this abandoned dock
Covered in ocean spray I'll paint
A greenpeace flag
To protest and preserve
Two, 'cause three's a crowd
