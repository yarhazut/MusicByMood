We live in this, this ain't the joke of a conspiracist, just genesis of a control that could be limitless, 'so people come get your benefits, cameras on all perimeters bordering on ridiculous, 'and we the ones they do business with', many predicted this warning to all citizens, ' 'cause we see none of these images', true journalists become dissidents.
Give us a way out, don't make us bring you down
You'll never silence the voices, silence this voice
Give us a way out... way out...
Stay diligent as we unfold who the villains is, cause innocents still being revoked of their privileges, 'so people come get ya benefits', administers of militance living terror for villages, 'and we the ones they do business with', imagine they inflict on us similar type predicaments, 'cause we see none of these image' assisting their systems deliverance.
Give us a way out, don't make us bring you down
You'll never silence the voices, silence this voice
Give us a way out, don't make us bring you down
You'll never silence the voices, silence this voice
Give us a way out...
(Genesis of a control, that could be limitless, genesis of a control, that could be limitless)
Silence the voices!
Give us a way out...
(Genesis of a control, that could be limitless, genesis of a control, that could be limitless)
Give us a way out...
(The genesis of a control, that could be limitless)
Way out...
(Genesis of a control, that could be limitless, genesis of a control, that could be limitless)
Give us a way out...
(Genesis of a control, that could be limitless, genesis of a control, that could be limitless)
Give us a way out, don't make us bring you down
You'll never silence the voices, silence this voice
Give us a way out... way out...
Don't make us bring you down, give us a way out
Way out...
