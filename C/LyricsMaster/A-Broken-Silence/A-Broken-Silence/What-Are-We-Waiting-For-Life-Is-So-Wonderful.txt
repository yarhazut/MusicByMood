(Cactus)
What are we waiting for? It's only slipping away
(Torcha)
What can be done at all? My god, life is so wonderful
(Cactus)
What are we waiting for, it's only slipping away
(Torcha)
What can be done at all? My god life is so wonderful
Some claiming it's insane
To be driven for a change, should redirect aim
(Everything stays the same)
Living is great, fuck switching up lanes, perfect picture in my frame
(So sic and so vein)
Got many trying to cope
We ain't throwing no ropes, spent our pennies on dope
(Got plenty but we broke)
So soles choked in confusion, overdosed in potent illusions
Got people trying to climb that be teaching to the blind
The defeated in the mind, reasons to shine
Time to be wise, drama as the seas rise
Obama has that peace prize
(So believe what you like)
Middle east cries, feasting on their pipe lines
I can see it's high time that we need to define
Why people dying over resource exports
Human pawns, this world be a chess board
(Cactus)
What are we waiting for? It's only slipping away
(Torcha)
What can be done at all? My god, life is so wonderful
(Cactus)
What are we waiting for, it's only slipping away
(Torcha)
What can be done at all? My god life is so wonderful
Can we be blamed for our love of the benefits?
For how our brains stay drugged off the rhetoric
We well trained, don't touch any evidence
Despite relevance, where we headed is classified intelligence
March to this destiny, waltz with your memories
March to this destiny, waltz with your memories
March to this destiny, waltz with your memories
March to this destiny, waltz with your memories
You don't see nothing, I don't see anything
March to this destiny, waltz with your memories
You don't see nothing, I don't see anything
March to this destiny, waltz with your memories
You don't see nothing, I don't see anything
March to this destiny, waltz with your memories
You don't see nothing, you don't see, you don't see
(Cactus)
What are we waiting for? It's only slipping away
(Torcha)
What can be done at all? My god, life is so wonderful
(Cactus)
What are we waiting for, it's only slipping away
(Torcha)
What can be done at all? My god life is so wonderful
What we will be if we picture this dream?
What we gonna obtain by shifting the blame
Will be living estranged as victims of change
If we dig deep by lifting our sleeves then we all picture this dream
