So we've been away so long, we've got them stages torn
And we back from breaking point, that spot still vacant boys?
No room for new school kids, move bitch, that's ludicrous
Please excuse, the fumes are thick because for our future a fuse was lit
Look how I'm super rich, my fam, my new born kid
No mansions or supped up whips that cash ain't ruling shit
So as that roulette spins, I gamble through these chips
Could hang on crucifix to give thanks to the crew I'm with now
When the rhythm breaks down, we gonna give 'em praise
Now when the rhythm breaks down we gonna give 'em praise
Now when the rhythm breaks down we gonna give 'em praise
We gone give 'em praise, we gonne give 'em praise
Now when the rhythm breaks down we gonna give 'em praise
Now when the rhythm breaks down we gonna give 'em praise
Now when the rhythm breaks down, when the rhythm breaks down
So we've been away so long, we've got them stages torn
And we back from breaking point that spot still vacant boys
You can see our lane is taken now, see 'em stake it out like danger mouse
Waiting for the day that our flame is out but I spit propane
Cremate the crowd driven to destroy a nations doubt
I deliver like a boy on a paper route
But my fam ain't about for the paper count
They stay devout and face all rounds, undercards to major bouts
Seen stars in rain clouds, recharged waning powers
Let's make 'em proud and take the crown now
When the rhythm breaks down, we gonna give 'em praise
Now when the rhythm breaks down we gonna give 'em praise
Now when the rhythm breaks down we gonna give 'em praise
We gone give 'em praise, we gonne give 'em praise
Now when the rhythm breaks down we gonna give 'em praise
Now when the rhythm breaks down we gonna give 'em praise
Now when the rhythm breaks down, we gonna give 'em praise
When the rhythm breaks
When the rhythm breaks down
When the rhythm breaks
Now when the rhythm breaks down, we gonna give 'em praise
Now when the rhythm breaks down we gonna give 'em praise
Now when the rhythm breaks down we gonna give 'em praise
We gone give 'em praise, we gonne give 'em praise
Now when the rhythm breaks down we gonna give 'em praise
Now when the rhythm breaks down we gonna give 'em praise
Now when the rhythm breaks down, we gonna give 'em praise
We gonna give 'em praise now, when the rhythm breaks down
We gonna give 'em praise now, when the rhythm breaks
