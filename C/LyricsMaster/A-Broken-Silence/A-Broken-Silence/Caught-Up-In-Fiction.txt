I was caught up in fiction, I lied to the world
Told her a change won't follow
I told her don't waste your time anymore
A renegade gotta face a change
Stay away from them wasted days now break
Man, this the life of the cool folks
And them clich√© muso's reach for that ouzo
Keep drinking till that booze goes
Traveled more then a few roads
Worn are my shoe soles, some rapping for that kulo
I stayed glad with the kudos
Grabbing at fools gold from that spot I couldn't move
No, pinned back like judo, trapped Robinson Crusoe
We always blazed on the weekdays
And we normally sleep late pause then we replay
Sort of thought there'd never be change
But now I like my b' day for Torcha it's D-day
We always blazed on the weekdays
And we normally sleep late
Pause then we replay. Sorta thought there'd never be change
But now I like my b'day for Torcha it's D-day
I was caught up in fiction I lied to the world
Told her a change won't follow
I told her don't waste your time anymore
A renegade gotta face a change
Stay away from them wasted days now break
We got props for them hot bars
Been on dust like rock stars cuffed up in cop cars
Screaming out they should stop war
But every spot that we pub crawl none stop got brawls
Many chasing that feeling and by age twenty-eight
Probably wasted a million
From this day dig my heals in, I'll never be Bill Gates
But I'm gonna build for my children
So what it took to be a man now is put some plans down
Never look for them hand outs
Now torch in the cockpit, what's more it's a rocket
We off, watch this
Many thinking you're at loss kid
Piss poor were them options naught in my pockets
Many thinking your at loss kid
Piss poor were them options naught in my pockets
Many thinking you're at loss kid
Piss poor were them options naught in my pockets
Since the call from the doctors
I had my bad thoughts packed all into boxes
I was caught up in fiction I lied to the world
Told her a change won't follow
I told her don't waste your time anymore
A renegade gotta face a change
Stay away from them wasted days now break
So I told her I'm switching up
To live it up with a different buzz, now that wisdom's come
So I told her I'm switching up
To live it up with a different buzz, now that wisdom's come
So I told her I'm switching up, so I told her
I told her a change won't follow
A renegade, gotta face the change
Stay away from the wasted days now break
I told her a change won't follow
A renegade, gotta face the change
Stay away from the wasted days now break
I told her a change won't follow
A renegade, gotta face the change
Stay away from the wasted days now break
I told her a change won't follow
A renegade, gotta face the change
Stay away from the wasted days now break
I told her a change won't, I needed a change though
I told her don't waste your time anymore
