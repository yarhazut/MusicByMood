Some it's how they brought up
Some they got caught up
Some they been tortured
Their thoughts stayed dormant
Then they started morphing
Got hardly any caution
Seemed nutty talking
Was buddy's now we awkward
Touched to many coffins, seen too many lost ones
Many like porcelain cracked in an instant
Poor to rich kids the off balance to the gifted
Mental states don't discriminate
When they penetrate, like a renegade
That saw the fate of my many mates
On a steady chase inclined to celebrate on any day
Elevate, getting high I couldn't levitate
To see the state of their minds and had to get away
No one demonstrates what to do in situations
In these cases when they talking too outrageous
(Damn)
So we soon became strangers
No one educates we knew none of the dangers
(Cactus)
She never lets him see inside
(Torcha)
And he don't ever see the pain that's caught inside
(Cactus)
If she could see the world through his eyes
(Torcha)
And she don't ever see the pain that's caught inside
(Cactus)
We were so blind
(Torchs)
We don't ever see the pain that's caught inside
(Cactus)
They tried, we tried
(Torcha)
We don't ever see the pain
Spent days trying to control that thought train
'Cause to get to that happiness state we all aim
Trying to find Nirvana some end like Cobain
Some go bananas can't vent so pour blame
On your self 'cause of wealth 'cause of life
'Cause you saw your relationship melt with your wife
'Cause ya parents hit you with a belt in the eye
'Cause ya doctor couldn't find the right pills to prescribe
Man, this is life, this is everyday more of us
Rich or poor, internal war be borderless
Scientists been trying to get the core of this
Unlocked doors but be stuck in the corridors
Horrors of dealing with the unknown
Think your alone but don't know who followed you home
We silent though, about these issued as a whole
So now we missing those that slipped in to there hold 'cause
(Cactus)
She never lets him see inside
(Torcha)
And he don't ever see the pain that's caught inside
(Cactus)
If she could see the world through his eyes
(Torcha)
And she don't ever see the pain that's caught inside
(Cactus)
We were so blind
Before some ever get to live walls collide
And we don't ever see the game
That's fought inside
Before some ever get to live walls collide
And we don't ever see the games that's fought inside
