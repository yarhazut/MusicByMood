And you could be the one that saves me
Living in my world, you know it's crazy
I feel the truth confirming lately
You could break me out this daydream
And you could be the one that saves me
Living in my world you know is crazy
I'm thinking now girl, just maybe
You could break me out this daydream
This is my lane, please you won't change me
These lyrics gaze deep, target main themes
Far from mainstream, best to pave roads
Whether we stay broke or destined for payloads
I've been wasteful lord is my witness
Stayed shit faced, burnt all of my bridges
Felt my brain was borderline twisted
So far from sane when your at a distance
And you could be the one that saves me
Living in my world, you know it's crazy
I feel the truth confirming lately
You could break me out this daydream
And you could be the one that saves me
Living in my world you know is crazy
I'm thinking now girl, just maybe
You could break me out this daydream
I've got a thirsting for the worst things
I should be working, I'm on my third drink
But I'm gonna turn things that's for certain
Hit my straps when they pull back that curtain
Cursing 'cause, gee, I got squat now
Still you're pushing me my dreams is your lot now
Most weeks I'm leaving to rock crowds
No sleep you see, it's one shot now
F the old route it's snap the moulds now
Man these cul-de-sacs and traps be my home grounds
Never sold out but can we hold out, give it another crack
Try and pan some gold out
So the loads now bigger than I thought
And my remedies been drinking till I'm warped
Future I'd see was vivid in my thoughts
And when it blinded me you'd steer me the right course
And you could be the one that saves me
Living in my world, you know it's crazy
I feel the truth confirming lately
You could break me out this daydream
And you could be the one that saves me
Living in my world you know is crazy
I'm thinking now girl, just maybe
You could break me out this daydream
