We gain benefits from a nemesis
We brought that harder edge to the penmanship
This is a renaissance, a genesis
See every breath brings you pestilence
To ridicule and finish you
'Cause none of these threats are subliminal
We not criminals but we sinners too
And patience that's left is so minuscule
It's been a few and we let it slide
But friendships are not standing the test of time
Can't hit rewind, so be set to find
Consequence as we sever ties
To hold a grudge is a potent drug
A total buzz
(So smoke it up)
'Cause motives was so corrupt
Such phony fucks gone and blown the trust
So we closing up
You find pleasure in tearing down
All that we burn for but I found
Freedom in closing the door
Enough is enough
We're closing it up, we're closing it up
We're militant with diligence our innocence
Killed by the villainous
To build again is real revenge
Take your thirty pieces of silver man
Middleman with little scams
That give your kicks like a river dance
We killed your plans of milking bands
Fuck a deal now, we deal with a million fans
Our enterprise, re-energized
Truth serum is piled in this pen of mine
Verify men from mice
From venomous smiles and pathetic lies
Like Gemini's with many sides
Their energy spent where the pennies lie
Imbedding spines with machete, knives
Now for attempts we be very wise
Identified, they identified
You find pleasure in tearing down
All that we burn for but I found
Freedom in closing the door
Enough is enough
We're closing it up, we're closing it up
Memories here be so bitter sweet
You're taking our dreams to the guillotine
Memories here be so bitter sweet
You're taking our dreams to the guillotine
Memories here be so bitter sweet
You're taking our dreams to the guillotine
Memories here be so bitter sweet
You're taking our dreams to the guillotine
Memories here be so bitter sweet
You're taking our dreams to the guillotine
Memories here be so bitter sweet
You're taking our dreams to the guillotine
You find pleasure in tearing down
All that we burn for but I found
Freedom in closing the door
Enough is enough
We're closing it up, we're closing it up
Enough is enough, we're closing it up
We're closing it up, we're closing it up
Enough is enough, we're closing it up
We're closing it up, we're closing it up
