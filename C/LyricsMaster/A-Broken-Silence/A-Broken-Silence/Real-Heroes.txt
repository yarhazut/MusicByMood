Born in Bondi with a keen eye for politics
Many got degrees but don't know what knowledge is
Acknowledge his dedication to the truth
And he never changed name just for chasing lute
So today he remains of the few
Ain't here for fame, dedication to that news but
Not the news that your seeing on fox
Ecause they label his views as treasonous plots
Believe it or not he's a prize winning professor
Been a front line eye witness to terror
Been threatened to leave countries
And had death threats
Made me believe how we deceived by you west press
And now I know why these secrets are best kept
Right after his readings I be needing a stress test
A best bet for those not familiar
Check the intellect of Mr. John Pilger
Real heroes are hard to come by
Lived in darkness but strived for sunshine
The human race would rise as one kind
If these lies hypnotized our young minds
Sunshine
Born to a tribe in a south Africa village
In a country wealth but without any privilege
His land pillaged by settlers with greed on their mind
They showed no respect so no peace he could find
He would read all the time, be speaking his mind
Be a lead to the blind so his people would climb
Free speech was a crime in the time that he lived
Apartheid had people divided by skin
And not a guy to give in on a quest to be free
Twenty seven years of life in a penitentiary
Finished off degrees in Bothe law and arts
So smart, leaving court rooms torn apart
Showed heart like Phar Lap on release from jail
Said, "We are all one people let peace prevail"
Without fail we raise a glass in health to this fella
The selfless path of Mr. Nelson Mandela
Real heroes are hard to come by
Lived in darkness but strived for sunshine
The human race would rise as one kind
If these lies hypnotized our young minds
Sunshine
Real heroes are hard to find
With super powers that really exist
That influence the hearts of men
Who could you turn to
If we did not have direction and inspiration
From men like this, from men like this
Real heroes are hard to come by
Lived in darkness but strived for sunshine
The human race would rise as one kind
If these lies hypnotized our young minds
Sunshine
