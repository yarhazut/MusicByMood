G'day world, how ya doing?
You in a palace or house in ruin
We all struggle, no doubt we human
But we grinding out solutions
Inner peace can be illusive
When following dreams so ruthless
But family be crucial
Can see that I've been clueless
To the truest of epiphanies
That switching you to my centerpiece
Would come renew that energy
Be mutual dependency
Still love my boozed up memories
Of cigar fumes and Hennessey
I drafted new itinerary
A blueprint for future legacy
So hold on, I'm steering
Strength has come, I'm leading
A soldier, fearless
Why scream, no one can hear us
So hold on, I'm steering
Strength has come, I'm leading
A soldier, fearless
Why scream, no one can hear us
So fearless, so fearless
So fearless and all the fear is gone
So fearless, so fearless
So fearless and all the fear is gone
Once based my days on chasing fame
And chasing dames to make a name
My soul became a vacant place
Then over came a saving grace
After all the labor pain a heart
Could never stay the same
My path it did fade away
A starring role nature played
Grasping on a razor blade to check
That this is logical
Pacing in that hospital
Waiting on a doctors moves
I can take a knock or two
But to hold a tears impossible
Done with fear, cut that loose
It's time to be a rock for you
So hold on, I'm steering
Strength has come and I'm leading
A soldier, fearless
Why scream, no one can hear us
So hold on, I'm steering
Strength has come and I'm leading
A soldier, fearless
Why scream, no one can hear us
So fearless, so fearless
So fearless and now the fear is gone
So fearless, so fearless
So fearless and now the fear is gone
So hold on, I'm steering
Strength has come and I'm leading
A soldier, fearless
Why scream, no one can hear us
So hold on, I'm steering
Strength has come and I'm leading
A soldier, fearless, fearless
