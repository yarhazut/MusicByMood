Step on anyone on your mission to rise up
Human brethren have been listening to liars
Killing for wealth or religion is a virus
Rebelling from wisdom that guides us
Bombs loaded, caught in the moment
No thought just war with opponents
Pay that mortgage with my bonus
No thought of where your home is
Gotta get my kids tuition
Hope the missile hits with precision
To stop a terrorist ambition
Them or us, quick decision
Hurry up, pick your mission
We fall for anything, everything has a right price
For better results you need to evolve to move me
Destroy enemies, bury them till my minds right
It's taken it's toll, your way to involved
To see that you fall too easy
We fall for anything, everything has the right price
Yeah, you fall so easy
Step on anyone on your mission to rise up
Human brethren have been listening to liars
Killing for wealth or religion is a virus
Rebelling from wisdom that guides us
Bombs loaded strapped to my vest now
So hopeless mad at the west now
Been told a bomb is my best route
Explode and God he will bless thou
My lands under occupation
And we're branded abominations
Circled by a domination, god damn, I've lost my patience
I'm blowing up a station, paradise my consolation
We fall for anything, everything has a right price
For better results you need to evolve to move me
Destroy enemies, bury them till my minds right
It's taken it's toll, your way to involved
To see that you fall too easy
We fall for anything, everything has the right price
Yeah, you fall so easy
See the likes of us, we fight don't run
See the likes of us, we fight don't run
See the likes of us, we fight don't run
For the plied of the righteous ones
See the likes of us, we fight don't run
For the plied of the righteous ones
See the likes of us, we fight don't run
For the plied of the righteous ones
See the likes of us, we fight don't run
For the plied of the righteous ones
See the likes of us, we fight don't run
See the likes of us, we fight don't run
See the likes of us, we fight don't run
See the likes of us, we fight don't run
