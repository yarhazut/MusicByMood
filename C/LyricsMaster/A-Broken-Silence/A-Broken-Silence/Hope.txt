Many are stained with souls corrupt
Hope they locate change when old enough
A message that I got when growing up
Is drink and smoke pot until ya throwing up
So is the world getting colder?
Nah, then I look where them soldiers are
Wonder why I just wrote that bar
Where we living is poles apart
With open hearts I see people building
A bridge to the world to feed some children
A new light to lead some millions
Fight evil, be resilient
Role models saying, "Grip that gun"
We marching to a different drum
Drugs will bring you a fist of funds
But make your journey a twisted one
Just begun to see duty's change
Seek truth not pursuit of fame
Some choosing to fuel them flames
But they looking like fools today
If the youth decay, focus dies
Time to retrain mobilize
Them old ways have been pulverized
We got a new table to roll that dice
Inner demons like a poltergeist
Had us living so cold as ice
But now kids got global eyes
Hopes alive
Conquer fear, new ideas, see these kids
Pioneers for future years, visions clear
What this is, this is hope, this is hope
New ideas, see these kids
Pioneers for future years, visions clear
What this is? This is hope
Conquer fear, new ideas, see these kids
Pioneers for future years, visions clear
What this is, this is hope, this is hope
New ideas see these kids
Pioneers for future years, visions clear
What this is, this is hope
Like they sing in Liverpool, you'll never walk alone
Any girl any fella from a broken home
Anyone neglected in a warring zone
Lost their abode and was forced to roam
Still they spoke in the warmest tones
Kept hope as a cornerstone
From these gifts we ought to grow
I quit spitting them morbid poems
Like cortisones to stop the hate swelling
Still see pain in locked away felons
Still need change and lots of rebelling
Use brains
We got to be heading in the right direction
Right progression, Minds can be quite perplexing
My confession, Life is testing
And positive thought fights depression
Like songs of Michael, read the Bible, read Koran
Heed disciples, love is vital in the eyes of Buddha
And even scribes from the tribes of Judah
One word to describe the future, hope
Conquer fear, new ideas, see these kids
Pioneers for future years, visions clear
What this is, this is hope, this is hope
New ideas, see these kids
Pioneers for future years, visions clear
What this is, this is hope
Conquer fear, new ideas, see these kids
Pioneers for future years, visions clear
What this is, this is hope, this is hope
New ideas see these kids
Pioneers for future years, visions clear
What this is, this is hope
What this is, what this is
What this is, this is hope
See these kids, this is hope
Futures here, this is hope, this is hope
Conquer fear, new ideas, see these kids
Pioneers for future years, visions clear
What this is, this is hope, this is hope
New ideas, see these kids
Pioneers for future years, visions clear
What this is, this is hope
Conquer fear, new ideas, see these kids
Pioneers for future years, visions clear
What this is, this is hope, this is hope
New ideas, see these kids
Pioneers for future years, visions clear
What this is, this is hope
