Flicking through photos as our childhood starts to fade away
As we've grown seen some of the wildest,
Many of our greatest days
Some succeeded, stagnated, didn't make the grade
Some of us lost hope and put our faith up in the latest craze
With something so potent they lost focus
Couldn't stay sain
Many dreams they went up in smoke
From the day they became a slave
Were they lost souls looking for ways to entertain their brain?
Couldn't strain friendships and made it hard
To go against the grain
On a lonely road where no one is on a quest for change,
To get control then at best you must confess today
Barely a cent after rent in a mess you stay
Savings are spent, invested in the stress and decay
Do we rest the blame on the shoulders of society?
Who let it creep through although they know its notoriety?
If I could take your past and hold it where your eyes can see
To show you've joined a long line
That be folding up them brightest dreams
Sometimes the city can suck you in to its habits
Where it's easier to sink than to manage
Let it go
Sometimes even the loudest people in a crowded place
Feel drowned out and start to think they're alone
Another day another broken dream
We try to bring 'em out the dark again but there they go
Don't know where to go
Don't know where to go
My city try to throw 'em off they don't know where to go
Sometimes the city can suck you in to its habits
Where it's easier to sink than to manage
Let it go
Another day another broken dream
We try to bring them out the dark again but
There they go
Often I'm pacing, thought's be racing
Asking questions why the privileged waste
And those in despair make the best of life?
What separates those with lesser drive from the rest that shine?
Why do some rise up in testing times? Some are less inclined
Morals clouded, soaked up in these pesticides
Couples giving birth so the baby bonus cheque arrives
We twisted, too slow to even get their vibe
Went from A to B so quick, couldn't connect the lines
Since it got a grip on these streets and started clenching tight
Tensions increase and so has tendencies to crime
Bodies waste away
On those who were once the energetic type
No class or race divides this epidemic strike
It's not a new find, fragility of the human mind
But to reality many have shut the door
Drew the blinds, isolated
In this modern worlds new design
Where no one's got the time to try and stop em
From the noose they're tying
