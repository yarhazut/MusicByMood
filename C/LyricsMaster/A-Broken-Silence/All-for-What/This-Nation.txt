Certain things make me stop for a minute
And thank my lucky stars that I got inderpendance
Where I walk, what I talk what I drop in each sentence
Never been did like david hicks and got locked without sentence
And thank god in remembrance, all them lives that were ended
We got freedom, so many died to defend this
Pops is no killer but had to put a knife to appendix
And our forefathers tails, bare a striking resemblance
So when I try to refresh this, put it right in perspective
Hearing their stories, have enlightened my senses
And enabled me to cherish every waking moment
We in that lucky country where your brains your main opponent
I made that focus outward cause to cope in our hood
Is easier than impoverished lands that go without food
On the reg (regular) we celebrating
It's a credit to this nation, just complaining for house prices
Petrol, inflation.
This nation
We raised in
How to speak
Speak your mind
Celebrate
We ain't raised in
A place we're survival is the prize
The grass is always greener, yeah that sounds about right
Unless the fence that you describe is topped with razerwire
You fight for the sake of it, or ninety nine percent
Just trying to make a shake of it
And yo you must be mistaking if you
Can't see your stake in it is greater than the vast majority
And you can stand there growling at authority
'Cause we still got a democracy, and what that means
Is you can say what you feel
And they can't put you under lock and key
So many disappeared, so many lived in fear
But you know that here man, your brains the opponent
So many blown opertunities in the land of plenty
So many cats that let there souls run on empty it gets tempting
To let it all slide, make fate the fall guy
And join the could have been's, should have been's or would have beens
In the backstreets of broken dreams and if it feels hopeless
Man, drop that wish list and refocus
This nation
We raised in
How to speak
Speak your mind
Celebrate
We ain't raised in
A place we're survival is the prize
Got pride in my birthplace but shame also resides
Many roads here paved with betrayal and genocide.
Dad made his way here, he was craving a better life
Didn't want another air raid waking him in the night
But things changed right, It's all a little stricter
Policies mixed with the riddles of a mini hitler
Our diggers stay allied it really is the bigger picture
Over lies they die its really so the rich are richer
That shit'll twist ya, but still I'm a patriot
I pay for taxes, these multinationals don't pay for shit
The earths tombstone, they engraving it
We used to swim in these rivers now we afraid to fish
Not a doomsayer but still we got to brace for this
Make a switch or modern life, could be an ancient myth
Take a trip and witness that beauty outside
This place is tatted on my heart, enough proof of my pride
