She's set up in her ways staying awful thin, he's fed up being poor and
Got laws to bend, everywhere I walk distortion is, but are you not
Entertained? Of course you is
She's set up in her ways staying awful thin, he's fed up being poor and
Got laws to bend, everywhere I walk distortion is, but are you not
Entertained? Of course you is, everywhere I walk, distortion is, but are you not entertained, of course you is.
Obsessed from a young age, cool as, guns blazed, none safe, ignorance is
On the front page, at some stage man, we slipped into some dumb phase,
Filled with pictures of bitches up in a drunk daze, some times I can't
Believe what they be feeding us, gossip it got the medias obedience,
Toxic, they got us reading about some deviants, they prefer
Photogenic over genius, ingredients to aid self destruction,
Popularity increases if ya fail to function, intelligence equates to
Sales of nothing, I reminisce on tapes that were laced with substance,
When investigative news the papers published, and all girls didn't
Think their body shapes repugnant, a great abundance of lives to
Idolize, modern scribes seem confined to meaningless diatribe, in my
Eyes, in your eyes.

Got laws to bend, everywhere I walk distortion is, but are you not
Entertained? Of course you is

We got idols who's life got 'em stocking up pills, get the
Spotlight for piping, squandering mills (millions), rhymers who get
Shot, rob and they steal, rub off on the brightest, now they out
Popping tills, what's the appeal, what created the change up, not even
A teen she's caking her face with make up, is it human nature, a good
Girl gone bad, drinking wine in her house singing songs about rehab,
Stumbling home, ripped Jeans and knee scabs, skin and bone our
Culture seems to breed that, could it be that? They're vision of beauty
Is shallow, climbing poles shaking bootys like pussycat dolls,
Mindstate, undeveloped like tadpoles, that push our souls, see the
Imminent black holes, that hold that they got, outta control, but you
Know it don't stop... it's profitable, for my eyes, for your eyes,
For her eyes, it's right there.
She's set up in her ways staying awful thin, he's fed up being poor and
Got laws to bend, everywhere I walk distortion is, but are you not
Entertained? Of course you is
She's set up in her ways staying awful thin, he's fed up being poor and
Got laws to bend, everywhere I walk distortion is, but are you not
Entertained? Of course you is, everywhere I walk, distortion is, but are you not entertained, of course you is.
Why do they walk like this, why do they talk like this, simple
And plain they just caught where distortion is, why do we walk like
This, why do we talk like this, we ourselves change like up in this
Game we've been forced to fit. (twice)
