I only listened to one voice, defined as reckless
Till I heard another utter your time is precious
Never was concerned with them worldly pleasures
But when I'm buried my words will be unearthed as treasures
In drastic times, I'd revert to those measures
Of Putting hands in the dirt to search for what's better
Thirsting for cheddar like a rat in a dumpster
And that gave me the hunger to rap with such thunder
Was going under for a second, felt like a convicted man
And struggle was my sentence but now . bam
I'm doubling my efforts, regardless of whatever
Stumbles in my presence
Made my entrance
A cunning young apprentice and still
Ain't speak a speck about a gun or 'bout a necklace
My method is run until your breathless
There's nothing gained from something that's stress less
On every day we strained for this (We strained)
And got to say there's been pain for this (Been pain)
The life of them entertainers is (What)
Ain't the bliss that they claim it is (It is not)
On every day we strain for this
And got to say there's been pain for this
Experience we gained from this
We so thankful... we never came up quick
The race non-stop the pace, constant
Wake everyday and got to face some nonsense
Face the monsters, snakes to mobsters ...out there
Trying to take your conscience
Many working like slaves, its bonkers
And use potions to sedate 'cause they somber
I was taught to never trade the honour, that's laid upon ya
Got to train, be stronger
Your brain can wonder
Get side tracked, many types you gotta drive back
Sly rats and the type that like to wise crack
High cats smoking ice until their eyes black
Got you unable to write unless your pipes packed
Came the hard way, tried to fight facts
And started shedding some light upon the right maps
Most my youthful life, I was quite cracked
Till I 360ed, dynamited at the mind traps
Oh yes...
On every day we strained for this (We strained)
And got to say there's been pain for this (Been pain)
The life of them entertainers is (What)
Ain't the bliss that they claim it is (It is not)
On every day we strain for this
And got to say there's been pain for this
Experience we gained from this
We so thankful... we never came up quick
Might have thought I liked the stress, the fight, the test
A broken silence, no overnight success
Pay the toll gate mate you've arrived in the west
Where affluence meets with survival at best
Guess who's live upon the set
All eyes upon us, man we rising them bets
Raising the stakes, why they patiently wait
This the hour now, they faze in the greats
Was sidetracked when I came in the place
So I had to pay for my major mistakes
Changed my traits, realised what it takes
Can't be no passenger, man I'm a pilot them planes
Lived wild but now they got files on my name
Even ma knows now her child's come of age
So from the sunshine to the darkest of days
Went from basket case to master of a trade.
On every day we strained for this (We strained)
And got to say there's been pain for this (Been pain)
The life of them entertainers is (What)
Ain't the bliss that they claim it is (It is not)
On every day we strain for this
And got to say there's been pain for this
Experience we gained from this
We so thankful... we never came up quick
