We never really talked
Like father to son
We never got it said
When turned you were gone
All thoughts in my head
You were not always there
We never took the time
I didn't always care
When I was a little kid
You took me places to see
We never got to the end
The road is open for me
When I visit your grave
I remember your face
I see your clear eyes
I feel your embrace
We never talk
Like father to son
Like father to son
