I can't believe the world today
When understanding is all gone
When respect has lost its meaning
And the ego is praised high
I can't believe the world today
When all respect is gone
When understanding has lost its meaning
And the ego is praised high
I can't believe the world today
When understanding is all gone
When respect has lost its meaning
And the ego is praised high
I can't believe the things they say
When they turn their backs away
War and terror risin' up
When they go in for the kill
I can't believe the things they say
When they turn their backs away
War and terror risin' up
When they go in for the kill
I can't believe the world today
When understanding is all gone
When respect has lost its meaning
And the ego is praised high
