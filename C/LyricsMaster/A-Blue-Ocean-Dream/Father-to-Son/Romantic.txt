I saw a painting by Friedrich
The white cliffs of RÃ¼gen
It really had the colours
It really had the depth
It made me feel nostalgic
It made me feel romantic
I always been romantic
I always been romantic
So won't you light the candles
And won't bring me some whine
I will hold you tight
Until the end of time
I will tell you stories
You always longed to hear
I will hold you tight
All through the night
I always been romantic
I always been romantic
