I used to be so impressed
By the way you moved
And the way you dressed
Songs I used to adore
From R and F
And M.L. Gore
And in the dancehall
Electro plays
You could see
He's a retroboy
He knows his moves
In every way
You could see
He's a retroboy
When he's dancing
All alone
You could see
He's a retroboy
No one there
No one else around
You could see
He's a retroboy
I read a book about you
It took the edge of what I knew
I think the spark is gone
Although your light is shining on
And in the dancehall
Electro plays
You could see
He's a retroboy
He knows his moves
In every way
You could see
He's a retroboy
When he's dancing
All alone
You could see
He's a retroboy
No one there
No one else around
You could see
He's a retroboy
