You got to look
Beyond the stars
Silicon chips
And life on Mars
You got to see
Between the stripes
Of diet sodas
And Hollywood wives
In the middle of
Nowhere
In the middle of
The United States
In the middle
Somewhere
You can feel how
The earth rotates
You got to wake up
Just like me
Don't you believe
In all you see
In the middle of
Nowhere
In the middle of
The United States
In the middle
Somewhere
You can feel how
The earth rotates
