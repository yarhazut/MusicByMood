I've changed my way
It's a state in my mind
I've changed my name
I think we're two of a kind
I'm not asking for much
I'm not too extreme
Just your elegant touch
I think you know what I mean
It's a state in my mind
It's a state in my mind
Things I had to learn
Bridges I had to leave
Point of no return
Burning behind me
Sorry for the pain
My demons caused you
I hope our love sustain
And we make it through
It's a state in my mind
It's a state in my mind
