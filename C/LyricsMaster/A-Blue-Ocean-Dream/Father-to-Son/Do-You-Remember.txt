Two-thousand drummers
Couldn't beat the feeling
Of your soft voice
It gives me the real thing
Oceans and landscapes
All have its beauty
But it can never be compared
To your souls purity
Do you remember when we sat
In your car you held my hand
And I remember all you said
And all the dreams that we planned
I got to narrow them down
All my mistakes
I got to stay focused
Do what it takes
Do you remember when we sat
In your car you held my hand
And I remember all you said
And all the dreams that we planned
I got to narrow them down
All my mistakes
I got to stay focused
Do what it takes
