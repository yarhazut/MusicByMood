Good to see you by the ashes (?)
Looking for a plane crash
She thought the engine had survived
And was she still wearing the rain coat
Coming up
The road tonight
Stand the heat but I can't stand the light
Kind of fool
I've become
And this is how the engine guides the way
Gonna find the ocean if it kills me
Just 74 more miles to go
The moon ahead and the stars in tow
I'll just smile as I go by
And sons are out to pull you in
Let me help you, 'cause I can
Funny thing
The engine says
Me won for you (?)
My friend
I'm gonna climb the mountain if it kills me
Just 74 more miles to go
The moon ahead and the stars in tow
I'll just smile as I go by
It's not as far as it may seem
Let the engine keep you clean
And don't worry
It's all been arranged
74 more miles to go
The moon ahead and the stars in tow
I'll just smile as I go by
Not as far as it may seem
Let the engine keep you clean
And don't worry
It's all been arranged
74 more miles to go
The moon ahead and the stars in tow
I'll just smile as I go by
It's not as far as it may seem
Let the engine keep you clean
And don't worry
It's all been arranged
