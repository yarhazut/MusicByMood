Swallow the pills each day, "they will kill the pain, they will keep you sane", they say.
But you'll never be the same.
Disguise all the lies you hide. Behind your eyes, the darkness creeps inside your life.
You'll be staying home tonight.
How could this be happening to you
You hide behind lies for a life you despise,
The sorrow inside clouds your once perfect skies
A fallen angel that just can't seem to rise
You'll never be happy until the day you die.
Take me back, take me back, this guilty conscience is all that I have,
Its sad but true, I fell for you, but now this love lies bleeding
Everyday you get closer to the end my friend, you're wearing thin, it's too late. Falling further from my heart. Sometimes I close my eyes and I picture life with you by my side, it's too sad to think I'll never get that chance.
This can't be happening to you.
You hide behind lies for a life you despise
The sorrow inside clouds your once perfect skies
A fallen angel that just can't seem to rise
You'll never be happy until the day you die.
Take me back, take me back, this guilty conscience is all that I have,
Its sad but true, I fell for you, but now this love lies bleeding
Painful days have come in there numbers. A handful of pills will take care of the numbness
An absence of faith, an excess of fear
She silently wipes away her tears
Walk Away
As you sat on the bed with a gun in your hand, moments from your end pointed at your head.
I wish I could have saved you
Swallow the pills each day, "they will kill the pain, they will keep you sane", they say.
But you'll never be the same.
Disguise all the lies you hide. Behind your eyes, the darkness creeps inside your life.
You'll be staying home tonight
