SEAN: for about three years I've showed myself to you. left the book open on pages no one had ever read. with every mile traveled the distance grew shorter as we lay eyes on strange places. I have learned to embrace my future not slice my fear away. this is what you taught me and it will last long after the feedback has faded away. you gave me the ability to follow my heart. and this will stay with me long after we have "gone our separate ways"
SAL: this means everything to me. I've exposed myself to you and you've made me realize I'm not alone. thank you so much for giving that to me. with every word we speak. with every chord we play.
This will stay with me long after we've moved on.
