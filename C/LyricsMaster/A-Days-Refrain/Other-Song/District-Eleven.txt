SEAN: we are all pawns in this. it's not as simple as it appears at a glance. it would be so easy to push blame at one source. but many reivers lead to the ocean. the words we follow, and what we've forced to swallow down, is drowned in half-truths leaving many more questions than we started out with. leading us further from the truth.
SAL: Has it come to this? brainwashing students to instil brand loyalty and required by law to stare at slogans. but who's to blame for this lack of funding.
