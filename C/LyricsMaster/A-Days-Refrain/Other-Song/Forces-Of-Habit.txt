SAL: can someone take this burden away from me while I gasp for air and wipe the footprints off my back only to reveal the pain I've caused her. is there something wrong with me? I don't want it anymore.
SEAN: it's been seven goddamn years and I'm still living with it. you'd think it would have fallen away by now trampled under footsteps long since made, but it still rears it's ugly head turning day to night. and you know what I don't want it anymore.
