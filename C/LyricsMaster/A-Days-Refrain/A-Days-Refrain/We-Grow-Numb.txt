They gave me a sense of security, but what's my purpose? my life, it fades away
Now I'm nothing
Your money is not my life, this is my life and you can't take that away
You pay me, I cannot grow numb, this is my life
(It's not worth my time, it's not worth my life) sean: we are losing years off our lives
This path has been conceived in stone too carefully mapped out for you to back out now
I hope you're happy climbing ropes but I cannot help but feel that you can barely breath I hope you're happy chasing dreams, and look at you now you can barely breath
So move back from the door you're not going through
Were made to feel stuck controlled by our fear
When you're done dying remember our dreams because this is not what we planned, this is not what we planned WE LIED, WE LIED, REPLY, REPLY (what's funny is) only pain will greet your money
