The road is weighed down by the burden of a thousand different stories, none of which you'll ever know as we each head in our own way
And the light races by as we move through the rhythms and the patterns that make up our lives only to be repeated a million times, long after we have faded
As we search for permanence the wind whispers "move faster"
