Stop and brace yourself because this is going to hurt, brick walls don't bend, (struck by) the realization that this road ends, ill hold my breath and wait for whatever it is that I'll get in return for all my years of letting go
I hope that its worth it
So forget about all of your "maybes" and "somedays" and settle in to a life of staring into the eyes of just getting by
Collapse into the arms of defeat
Sal: does innocence die at age 21? surrounded by walls of expectations
The working class greets with open arms, and as I embrace my memory fades
Where did the past three years go? as I look back all I see is just a shadow of who I used to be
Now I feel like just another face in the crowd
