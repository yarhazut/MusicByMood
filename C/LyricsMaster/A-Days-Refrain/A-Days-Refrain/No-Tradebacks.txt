Sean: I never meant to hurt you I got lost in dreams, but please I couldn't bear to lose you
I was there, I was alone, I was there and I'm never going back
Stare at ceilings and run your hand against this wall to hold back your tears
I place my hand inside yours, it never felt this cold
I can still hold onto those days before the tears washed traces away, and I am sorry I broke these pictures, but please don't push me away
I left that place
I could not survive
But I never meant to abandon you
And I can still feel your breath on my neck
So let your breath out, close your eyes, hold your hands out and say goodbye sal: I held on for as long as I could to dreams that were my life and I'm afraid I can't return
So ill try to slip away from reality
