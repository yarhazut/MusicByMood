She stands true to herself, the same person as always. yet you spoke phrases that ended in words like forever. and I can't understand how this affects you. I guess ill never understand how this affects you. she stands true to herself and your afraid of what people say. or is it more than that? has all of this meant nothing? she can't change who she is, you cannot change who you are, I can't change who I am, who are you to judge, she cannot change
Sean: nothing has changed except for your perception. she still stands the same alone and strong. I thought I remembered promises and I still don't understand how this affects you. she stood through all our petty melodrama and you just turn and forget. nothing has changed since the day that you met her except for you. her love feels just like yours and you (think you) can judge what's pure. its funny how two words can change four years. so find your strength from inside.
