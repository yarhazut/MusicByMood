I think there was supposed to be some sort of affection, but you surrounded yourself with your self-indulgence, and I hid in shadows and learned to lose respect
Through explanations and accusations I watched you struggle with your conscience, but you have a knack for justifying yourself
Your importance does not seem so important anymore
