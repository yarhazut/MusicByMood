One spring morning
Six years ago
Felt the shadow strangle home
And the worry, oh no the phone
I hear the mourning, please come home
 
Within my own regret, my spirit go
Leaves the fires, the final blow
Get in conflict, I do recall
From the darkness calling for
 
I'll call for you
Choking on the white noise rushing
Howling from the great beyond
I'll call for you
I recall the fires raining down
 
There was yearing, stone cold
With the seaming waves of war
And the name breaks, haunting on
I lost key of all that ever were
Some as strong men, some sick may call
Seen the judge before your own
Then you worry, your ways are mourning
Found my heart in those who gave you warmth
 
I'll call for you
Choking on the white noise rushing
Howling from the great blue
I'll call for you
I recall the fires raining down
 
Cherry, awesome, wild and free
Can you still remember your sister and me?
Cherry, a wild cherry tree
I still remember you and me
Cherry, awesome, wild and free
Forever remember your sister and me
Cherry, wild river to the sea
I still remember you and me
