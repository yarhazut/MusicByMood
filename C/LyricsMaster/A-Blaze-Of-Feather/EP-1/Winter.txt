I don't know why I need to be alone
And dance around the secret I suppose
There ain't no time, oh no, for growing old
There ain't no hiding from, the glass still glows
There's only air, here for the dawn
In case you're dying, the shadow, cursed and cold
Into the storm
Burn, rejoice
Burn to the storm
We'll burn, is it sworn?
Brace my friend, I need, I miss love
Wish I could turn the tide, and more will grow
When I was in I'd still remember
The endless birth
My only shelter from the dark
