Sorry is a word I fail to say
Struggle with the hurt, the weight, the pace
Trouble in the darkness shifting shade
I miss her every time I try and change
I'm waiting on you
Hoping those broken wings hold through
I can never come in the light of day
Under night memory tears me
Raising my head like a hurricane
Carousel shadows calling
Dancing
I'm waiting on you
Hoping those broken wings hold through
Still haunted by you
When the lights go
Will you pull through
(Ben Howard)
With my last breath
I comfort you
I'm waiting on you
Hoping those broken wings hold through
Still haunted by you
When the lights go
Will you pull through
I'm waiting on you
Hoping those broken wings hold through
Still haunted by you
When the lights go
Will you pull through
