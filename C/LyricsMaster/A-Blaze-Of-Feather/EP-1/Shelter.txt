This is shallow porcelain (?)
May your tears away
Hell bent on happiness
Wishing the truth away
How far we fell
And those stuck way below (?)
?
Look at us now sister
With echo
Resembling surface (?)
I know it's weakened trust (?)
Just trying to cut to the truth
Find some kind of shelter
Seems all we are is desert
Taking cover from the raging
And confusion
Just trying to cut to the truth
Find some kind of shelter
Seems all we are is desert
Taking cover from the raging
Confusion
Confusion
Making my way down with (?)
Seems I lost my oldest friend
More than blood between our bones
The last one
With after
Some day when we're out of town
? again
Felt the black beneath my feet
?
Stop skipping away
We're secret (?)
?
I don't believe it
I don't believe it
I don't believe it
