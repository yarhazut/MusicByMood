But we still shine
Walk the line, waiting by
Dirty Windows, Broken Stairs
Looking for something that isn't there
The day you left, such a mess
Long times gone, and lay to rest
But we still shine
Walk the line, waiting by
Hopefuly wishes, Scared to death
Feeling shakey what comes next
We find the ways aren't so hard
Tomorrow better days, here in your heart
But we still shine
Walk the line, waiting by
Getting over, getting through
Getting over, thoughts of you
But we still shine
Walk the line, waiting by
But we still shine
Walk the line, waiting by
Getting over, getting through
Getting over, thoughts of you
Thoughts of you
