Where did we go wrong this time?
Did I say something that you didn't like?
We've been over this a thousand times
I would take it back if it could change your mind
I guess it doesn't matter
I don't mean a thing to you
Will it feel the same when it falls apart?
Right before you go
Let me tell you
That I don't care anymore
Walk out the door
No wait don't leave me
