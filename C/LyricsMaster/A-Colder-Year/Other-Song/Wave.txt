"Wave"
I shouldn't find this funny
But maybe after all
I'm crawling and I'm spitting
Down on the stairs in the hall
But I'll wave when I'm gone from here
I'll turn the lights on and disappear
I talk when words are ugly just to make sense of the floor
And I can't see through the smoke, or I can't breathe anymore
But I'll, I'll set you, set you on fire
Burning trees break her heart
I won't leave too soon
Just shine
Down shine
Shine down
