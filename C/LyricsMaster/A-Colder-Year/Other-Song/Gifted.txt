Maybe I'm alone, in all of this
Or maybe its something, that we just missed
Its gone on to long, to sad words
For this song, throw another four letter smile out
Go away, I don't think we can be friend
What makes you think
Your gifted
What makes you think
Your gifted
What makes you think
Your gifted
What makes you think
Your gifted
Taken awhile to write, all this down
It's been a long time, since I've heard a sound
Its gone on to long, to sad words
For this song, throw another four letter smile out
Go away, I don't think we can be friend
What makes you think
Your gifted
What makes you think
Your gifted
What makes you think
Your gifted
What makes you think
Your gifted
After all this time
Go away, I don't think we can be friend
What makes you think
Your gifted
What makes you think
Your gifted
What Makes you think
Your gifted
What makes you think
Your gifted
Now
