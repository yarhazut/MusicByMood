"Pillbox"
I've made it this far
A brand new year
Another birthday gone
My shallow hearted friend
It's all in this pill box
These words for you
A song for my friend
Something so brand new
Kerosene burns up still
Your star shines bright
Its on your shoulder
The one to the right
We can go for a drive x 2
Just soothe me x 3
Just
I'm not afraid anymore, ill just let you drive x 2
Soothe me
