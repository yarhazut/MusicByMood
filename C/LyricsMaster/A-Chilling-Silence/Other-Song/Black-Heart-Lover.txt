Misplaced in a world of broken beauty queens
I cut the throats of lovers to save myself
Call me selfish... I call it smarts
Look into my eyes, I'll tear you apart
I'll kiss you than kill you without feeling a thing
A hopeless romantic, with a heart of gold.
You fell for every word I said
Now close your eyes and say goonight
They call it murder, I call it passion
So sick of holding my heart in my hands
No more crying eyes and long goodbyes
I replace love with lust... oh I'll pretend to care,
Take off your clothes bite my lip and pull my hair
A sadistic admirer, with a razor tongue.
I find it cute how you sell yourself short
You're lying in my bed
And I don't even know your name
Fall for words, as you fall for me.
You call this love, I call this a hobby
I'm just your black heart lover
You don't mean anything to me
You're just a game I played and beat
Burn your heart, burn the sheets
You fell for every word I said
Now close your eyes and say goonight
They call it murder, I call it passion.
