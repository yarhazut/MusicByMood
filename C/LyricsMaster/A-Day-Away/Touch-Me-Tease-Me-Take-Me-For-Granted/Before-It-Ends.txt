We're taking everything
One step at a time
Holding on to you and I
And now we're holding hands
And walking in the sand
And hoping that this will not end tonight 
Take a picture, stories told
Hold my hand and don't let go
Tell me that I'm every thing you need
And this is the last thing I'll say
And this is the last thing I'll say, before it ends
Before it ends
Living day by day
Throwing cares away
And hoping that tomorrow won't come
Looking in your eyes
Never felt so nice
I wanted to freeze the hands of time
Take a picture, stories told
Hold my hand and don't let go
Tell me that I'm every thing you need
And this is the last thing I'll say
And this is the last thing I'll say, before it ends
Hold my hand and cut the ties
Remember this for all our lives
Hold my hand and cut the ties
Remember this for all our lives
With you
With you
With you
Take a picture, stories told
Hold my hand and don't let go
Tell me that I'm every thing you need
And this is the last thing I'll say
And this is the last thing I'll say
And this is the last thing I'll say, before it ends
Take a picture, stories told
Hold my hand and don't let go
Tell me that I'm every thing you need
And this is the last thing I'll say
And this is the last thing I'll say
And this is the last thing I'll say
And this is the last thing I'll say, before it ends
