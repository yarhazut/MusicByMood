She'll take a chance on this boy
Missiles launched and she's deployed her plan to understand him now
And she don't know where he's been
But she'll find a reason
To let a love pass her by again
And don't say it didn't mean a thing
After all those silly songs I'm singing
No, you've blown your thoughts to shore
It's the moment we live for
Don't let it slip out the back door
Don't let life pass you by
And your heart's saying "yeah, let's go"
But your mind's saying "oh no"
Don't let love die tonight
'Cause she's not all right
She's like a wine that's fine with age
But she can't find it in her heart to change the way she feels about me now
And like a star that's far away
I took the fall and she's to blame
My heart is tangled in her now
And don't say it didn't mean a thing
After all those silly songs I'm singing
No, you've blown your thoughts to shore
It's the moment we live for
Don't let it slip out the back door
Don't let life pass you by
And your heart's saying "yeah, let's go"
But your mind's saying "oh no"
Don't let love die tonight
'Cause she's not all right
It's the moment we live for
Don't let it slip out the back door
Don't let life pass you by
And your heart's saying "yeah, let's go"
But your mind's saying "oh no"
Don't let love die tonight
'Cause she's not all right
