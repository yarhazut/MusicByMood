Like Miss America trying to live her dream
She's just another teenage drama queen
And I'm just a boy that's stuck at home
I'll slip this note into your locker, reply yes or no
Look at the time, c'mon baby let's go
Oh, you have my heart, you're in control
Did my plan backfire right in my face?
Can you see the smoke rising oh from your place?
And you knew all along what was wrong
And so I'm leavin' this message on your phone
Were you just too busy or just not home?
And I'll leave a message after the tone
And I'll hope for the best but prepare for the worst
Don't worry girl, I deleted you first
And goodbye, so long, farewell
The love was good, but life was hell
So here comes your little bit of fame
Silicone and yes lipstick will stain
To my face the color red
I cannot get you outta my head
I'll straighten up the top of you
But like a knife the jacket just won't just do
And I'm hanging on here by a thread
Go cut these trees, get out of my head
Did my plan backfire right in my face?
Could you see the smoke rising from your place?
And you knew all along what was wrong
And so I'm leavin' this message on your phone
Were you just too busy or just not home?
And I'll leave a message after the tone
And I'll hope for the best but prepare for the worst
Don't worry girl, I deleted you first
And goodbye, so long, farewell
The love was good, but life was hell
And if I don't answer I'm probably just avoiding
Cause conversation gets so annoying
And Leave a message after the tone
(Please leave a message, after the tone)
And so I'm leavin' this message on your phone
Were you just too busy or just not home?
And I'll leave a message after the tone
(Please leave a message, after the tone)
And I'll hope for the best but prepare for the worst
Don't worry girl, I deleted you first
And goodbye, so long, farewell
The love was good, but life was hell
