And hey there, you are, I try to start, by saying something smooth to you
And I'll kill, you say, as I stutter away, but I mumble out I love you
Driving fast tonight
And oh we're holding tight
And girl would you please write, tonight
Goodbye
And it's an addiction
Oh how I'm wishing I could have her back
And I can't, explain, why you drive drive drive drive me insane
But you do those things to me
And I'll kill, you say, as I stutter away, but I mumble out I love you
Driving fast tonight
And oh we're holding tight
And girl would you please write, tonight
Goodbye
And it's an addiction
Oh how I'm wishing I could have her back
And oh how I'm missing back when we were kissing
Oh we're growing fast
White fonzy, girls upon me said
Come and get your curly head back in bed
Back in bed
And it's an addiction
Oh how I'm wishing I could have her back
And oh how I'm missing back when we were kissing
Oh we're growing fast
(Can't get enough, won't let go)
And it's an addiction (Can't get enough, won't let go)
Oh how I'm wishing I could have her back (Can't get enough, won't let go)
(Can't get enough, won't let go)
And oh how I'm missing back when we were kissing (Can't get enough, won't let go)
Oh we're growing fast (Can't get enough, won't let go)
