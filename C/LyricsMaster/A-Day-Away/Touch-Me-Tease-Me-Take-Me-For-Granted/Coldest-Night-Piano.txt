Hey you, whatcha been up to?
It's been about a week or two
Since I last talked to you, just wanna know what's going on
I'm chillin' in my room
I'm killing time just thinking about you
And all those things that we've been through
The cold air's coming to take it's place
You see it coming, so embrace
The cold air's coming to take it's place
You see it coming, so embrace
And this is the coldest night of them all
The rain will freeze and snow will fall
To the ground, I'm falling down
I'm stuck here for another day
I'm driving in my car, around town, downtown
Hoping I might find you standing there
Like the star you are
All the guys are in their car
They start to scream your name
It drives me insane
The cold air's coming to take it's place
You see it coming, so embrace
The cold air's coming to take it's place
You see it coming, so embrace
And this is the coldest night of them all
The rain will freeze and snow will fall
To the ground, I'm falling down
I'm stuck here for another day
I gave you everything and you just walked out on me
I gave you everything
I gave you everything and you just walked out on me
I gave you everything
And this is the coldest night of them all
The rain will freeze and snow will fall
To the ground, I'm falling down
I'm stuck here for another day
