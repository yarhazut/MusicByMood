Here's to the note she wrote, well raise the bottle
Oh, got drunk and made out with a model
What the hell is going on tonight?
It seems I'm stuck in game mode
The settings are hit it and quit it, don't go home alone tonight
Girl, you're alright, girl, by my side
You weren't the best I've ever had
You weren't the best I've ever had
We're the boys with the cars that show off our scars that get the girls that rock your world
Don't you wish you knew what it was like to be me?
Here's to the note she wrote, well raise a finger
Obscene gestures, so she said
But I only said sweet things to get you in bed
And she was touching, teasing me
Her game was good, but I was playing easy
See I had the will to leave it alone
Though her words were mean she still escorted me home
And she said, "You're with the best you'll ever have"
And I said, "You're not the best I've ever had"
We're the boys with the cars that show off our scars that get the girls that rock your world
Don't you wish you knew what it was like to be me?
"Oh my god. This one's amazing. He's not like all the other guys"
"Dude, I think this girl's falling for me." "Yeah" "I don't know if I should, but it would be so easy"
Don't you wish, don't you wish you knew what
Don't you wish, don't you wish you knew what
Don't you wish, don't you wish you knew what
You weren't the best I've ever had
You weren't the best I've ever had
We're the boys with the cars that show off our scars that get the girls that rock your world
Don't you wish you knew what it was like to be me?
We're the boys with guitars, we're big rock stars
Yeah, we'll steal your girl, and rock her world
Don't you wish you knew what it was like
Don't you wish you knew what it was like to be me?
