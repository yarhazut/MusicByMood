What's with this heartbreaker?
It's a game and the winner must take her
Feed me these lines and tell me I'm fine when you knew all along that you were mine
And now, you say I'm out of line
You're running out of time
And can we go back, to where we started at?
(Just listen I know, you're feeling fine)
Now her phone it stops ringing
There's no hope for this girl but you'll keep it
Feed me these lines and tell me I'm fine when you knew all along that you were mine
And now, you say I'm out of line
You're running out of time
Can we go back, to where we started at?
(Just listen I know, you're feeling fine)
And now I'm sorry, the blame it's all me
Don't say I didn't try
(Just listen I know, you're feeling fine)
Bottom's up B, bottom's up, here we go
Bottom's up B, bottom's up, here we go
Bottom's up B, away we go
Bottom's up B, bottom's up, here we go
Bottom's up B, bottom's up, here we go
Bottom's up B, here we go
And here we go
And here we go
And here we go
Here we go
Can we go back, to where we started at?
(Just listen I know, you're feeling fine)
And now I'm sorry, the blame it's all me
Don't say I didn't try
Just listen I know, you're feeling fine
