Jamie loves him, but she doesn't want to leave this place today. She acts like everything's okay. B-Money. He could get the hunnies, but he chases them all away. He blushes when they say his name. 
Did you really think it'd last for good? Just jump ship like you would.

Terry's good at school but it drove him crazy. He dropped out because he's lazy. Now he works the night-shift all alone. Sarah had a man but she lost him to her best friend's double crossin'. Now she knows what it's like to be alone.
