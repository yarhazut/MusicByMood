Well, I sat down in the middle of the town,
And watched as life passed by.
An old man lied right next to me.
He had no clothes, he was alone.
So I started to think about my self.
What if I end up like him?
Would I stand to be alive?
Or would I fade away and die.
I don't know what to do.
I'm feeling like I'm growing up too fast,
And I don't know what I'm gonna be.
But time will show me where to go,
And guide me to my destiny.
I may be better off this way.
And right across the street from me,
Walked a wealthy woman. She had money.
I could see it just by the way she was.
So I started to think about my self.
What if I end up like her?
Would I stand to be alive?
Or would I fade away and die...
