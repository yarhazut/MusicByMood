It doesn't seem natural
It doesn't seem nothing for this
To happen like that
But we should choose running
Through unexpected crash
From what to come
Of this awkwardness
That you know
Well I don't know
But I, I miss her voice
As it's telling me to move
But I, I miss her voice
As it's telling me to lose control
Then it was her and me
And me and her
And everything was fine
So I thought for sure,
Something's real wrong
On this lovely day
And this is said,
We're on to something
I got to call
But she's not buying
And how long will you be
And why could you scratch up me
And what to come
Of this awkwardness
That you know
Well I don't know
But I, I miss her voice
As it's telling me to move
But I, I miss her voice
As it's telling me to lose control
Then it was her and me
And me and her
And everything was fine
So I thought for sure,
Something's real wrong
On this lovely day
And all we had was love
It's over
And all we had was love
Then it was her and me
And me and her
And everything was fine
So I thought for sure,
Something's real wrong
On this lovely day
