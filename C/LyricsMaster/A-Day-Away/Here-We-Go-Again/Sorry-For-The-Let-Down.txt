Twenty miles away from home
And I'm feeling so alone tonight, 
As cars pass us by. 
And the highway breeze, it's in my eyes. 
I'm counting mile marker signs. 
Why am I nervous to be home? 
We don't want to give it up, 
We just want to live it up. 
Woah-oh, oh oh oh oh. 
We don't want to give it up, 
We just want to live it up tonight. 
Well sorry for the letdown, 
But the pressure's off your back now. 
And you don't have to hear another word. 
I thought I'd write it in a letter, 
But a song sounded better- 
One more chance for my voice to be heard. 
I confess I think it's best if we go our separate ways 
Because giving up and running home sounds better everyday. 
I hope that you will some time as you enjoy your East Coast sky
With a piece of what you left behind still lingering in your mind.
We don't want to give it up, 
We just want to live it up. 
Woah-oh, oh oh oh oh. 
We don't want to give it up, 
We just want to live it up tonight. 
Well sorry for the letdown, 
But the pressure's off your back now. 
And you don't have to hear another word. 
I thought I'd write it in a letter, 
But a song sounded better- 
One more chance for my voice to be heard. 
Don't say you're sorry now
And don't you know you let me down? 
Well sorry for the letdown, 
But the pressure's off your back now. 
And you don't have to hear another word. 
I thought I'd write it in a letter, 
But a song sounded better- 
One more chance for my voice to be heard. 
Well sorry for the letdown, 
But the pressure's off your back now. 
And you don't have to hear another word. 
I thought I'd write it in a letter, 
But a song sounded better- 
One more chance for my voice to be heard. 
Don't say you're sorry now
And don't you know you let me down?
