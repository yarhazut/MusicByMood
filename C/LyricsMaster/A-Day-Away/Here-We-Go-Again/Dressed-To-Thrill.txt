It's 3 15 that time again
She leaves her house with her boyfriend
You know they're heading for disaster
In crash course on the dancefloor
Swinging to the beat
She leaves in close
He doesn't even see
There's that look in her eyes no
So move your feet
To the beat of the drama girl
I've been dressing down to thrill you
And these temptations
Lead the real sensations
I can feel you at
The tip of my tongue
Lets take that dress
She tries to look the best
And now she's got the crowds attention
She moves slow
The pressures building deep inside
And she can't find a way
To get of this dress
So move your feet
To the beat of the drama girl
I've been dressing down to thrill you
And these temptations
Lead the real sensations
I can feel you at
The tip of my tongue
Fairy tales are just a dream
Better loves that he won't meet
Just you're the one he thought it be no!
So move your feet
To the beat of the drama girl
I've been dressing down to thrill you
And these temptations
Lead the real sensations
I can feel you at
The tip of my tongue
