Black N' Blues"
Send "Black N' Blues" Ringtone to your Cell
So here's the toast
Of poetry and Misery
We Shake it up
And put it down a melody
This times are hard
But baby we've got hope
Yeah you know!
When your stomach's sick
And we start trembling
Let's give away to a dream
That is quietly
Sneaking at your window
Let's put your hand
On the daw
And all the truth
In that smile
So here we go
You turn up the radio
They bring a song
Is everybody singing along?
In other words
The crowd is getting wild
All the beats
Are getting stronger
C'me on baby ROCK IN!
You'll cry
On my shoulder tonight
And you'll ride
Just to improve your running
To blind to sing
About your soar
So dressed up
In the Black n' Blues
Cover it up
Like you're always doing
Think of me
When you hear this one
Just note
That you were wrong
And I swear
We're going somewhere
But she says
It's heading nowhere
Give it time and maybe
This will grow
So pack your bags
And don't look back now
My love's a gun
And I've got it straight down
She needed time
But I'm ready to aboard
So here we go
You turn up the radio
They bring a song
Is everybody singing along?
In other words
The crowd is getting wild
All the beats
Are getting stronger
C'me on baby ROCK IN!
You'll cry
On my shoulder tonight
And you'll ride
Just to improve your running
To blind to sing
About your soar
So dressed up
In the Black n' Blues
Cover it up
Like you're always doing
Think of me
When you hear this one
Just note
That you were wrong
So dressed up in the Black N' Blues
So sing Woh woh woah woah
And Baby Right Now!
