Feel my hands they started shaking
Fingertips running down my face
Made a mistake for not making
The right move,
I could not push her back, no
And push her back now
Push her back up against
Push her back now
Up against the wall
Push her back now
Push her back up against
The wall...
Woah, and everybody get down
Woah, and this is where she walks out
Woah, the ladies wants our hearts bound
Woah, and she's up to no good now
My walls are falling down
She comes around with a bottle, a crown
With her perfume held inside
It's kinda hard when she's riding her fix
And the slit of her skirt lets 'em know you're awake, yeah
And she'll soon be making
She'll soon be breaking
The promises that she can't keep, no
That she's the whore that the boys all adore
And excuses aside I've fallen for her
Woah, and everybody get down
Woah, and this is where she walks out
Woah, the ladies wants our hearts bound
Woah, and she's up to no good now
You're no good now,
No good now,
You're no good now
She's tearing off my clothes
She's breathing in my nose
I stop and recomposed
And can you smell her in tow
To tell her, no
Just push her back
I'll push her back now...
Push her back now
Push her back up against
Push her back now
Up against the wall
Push her back now
Push her back up against
Push her back now
Up against the wall
Push her back now
Push her back up against
Push her back now
Up against the wall
Push her back now
Push her back up against
Push her back now
Up against the wall
Woah, and everybody get down
Woah, and this is where she walks out
Woah, the ladies wants our hearts bound
Woah, and she's up to no good now
Woah, and everybody get down
Woah, and this is where she walks out
Woah, the ladies wants our hearts bound
Woah, and she's up to no good now
