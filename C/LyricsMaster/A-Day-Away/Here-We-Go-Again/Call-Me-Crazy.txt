So call me crazy and I'll say baby
Shut your mouth and hold your tongue
Could he love you
Does he love you
Like I do
The night has come to an end and her friends go home alone
But she stands by your side
In the moonlight as it glows
She's strippin' down to nothin'
But nothing makes you feel like something was accomplished
Her dress it hits the floor as she's screaming for just one more
So call me crazy and I'll say baby
Shut your mouth and hold your tongue
Could he love you
Does he love you
Like I do
So roll your eyes and just despise me
I'm the number hidden in your phone
Could he love you
Does he love you like I do
She's breathing faster as I kiss those lips
She swings her body as I grab those hips
She's biting her nails and grinding her teeth
The next thing I know she's all over me
I swear I swear just hold me close and he'll disappear
So call me crazy and I'll say baby
Shut your mouth and hold your tongue
Could he love you
Does he love you
Like I do
So roll your eyes and just despise me
I'm the number hidden in your phone
Could he love you
Does he love you like I do
So you think that you're in love but
We all know he doesn't love you
So you think that you're in love but
We all know HE DOESN'T LOVE YOU
No he doesn't't't love you
No he doesn't't't love you
So call me crazy and I'll say baby
Shut your mouth and hold your tongue
Could he love you
Does he love you
Like I do
So roll your eyes and just despise me
I'm the number hidden in your phone
Could he love you
Does he love you like I do
