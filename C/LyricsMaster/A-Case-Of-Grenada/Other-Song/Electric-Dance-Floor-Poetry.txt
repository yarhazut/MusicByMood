Electric dance floor poetry is everything that keeps us awake in terms of pale grey skies
Everything's all right
Everyone is dying
Everything's ok
Everyone is dead
Electric dance floor poetry is everything that keeps the bright side the side of my command
I said hey, you said so, I said hey, you said you rather went away
Don't run away, just go
Kill your honour
