You always keep your cuffs tight
You'll never keep us alive,
You will always be fake
Your hair is soaked with blood
I guess it's O.K.
This day is not on you side
I guess that's O.K. too
Think I'll take my chance
I guess it's O.K.
You said wait for me. No way
Will they come back? I think so.
They will never really be gone they're
Burned into my life they burned
