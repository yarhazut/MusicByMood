What's life? What's time? What's up? Yeah
What's your life compared to mine?
King for a day well so am I.
What's your life compared to mine it's all yours, so leave mine
What's your life compared to mine?
Your fate is changing one more time
How far is it today? You said all the way!
Watch the children walk all over you sit back and wait for better days.
