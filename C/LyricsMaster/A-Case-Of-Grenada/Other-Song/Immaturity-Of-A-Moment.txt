It's like a fire that burns down my hands even tough its cold
Its cold in here can you give me fire
You stand in front of me and laugh
Behind your back I know your holding a knife
This killing time will never end at least as long as life and death have command
This time they're crying about the loss of a few men
Last the crying was on the side of those who laugh
Have you ever felt pain?
We cry for a chance, this time we're all gonna be fine, it's time for you to make a change
Everyone I know, the liars and gamblers too what have you come for
Put the cards on the table
