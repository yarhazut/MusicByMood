Tell me where's your secret?
Is it in your vault? Tell me.
Truth is something I have never seen before
Can't tell what's happened a thousand times before
Can't tell what happened but the fire won't stop burning
Will they ever get the shit that they left behind?
They never come back, they never come back
Will they ever come and ease the pain they caused?
They never come back, they never come back
They're gone, a thousand miles away.
