Step up to the plate, don't be afraid.
I know the outcomes not straight,
But don't let your Father wait.
This thing has worn you down,
Another frustrating day.
But its crucial to be a man,
And send the evil one on his way!
Let go, Let go!
Break the chains and let go!
Let go, Let go!
You can't delay so let go!
This thing is taking you,
I know its breaking you,
It's not to hard to do,
Cause Christ will lead you through so let go!
