Is it your face, that I'll see when I wake up?
Oh when I wake
Is it your hands, that will pull me through again?
And over again
Is it your eyes, that I'll see when I reach the end?
When I reach the end
'Cause I'm so far down tonight,
I'm so far down,
Yes I'm so far down that I can't even see your plan
And I'm so tired of being wrong all the time
I need some assurance in my life,
That's why I need to know Lord,
I'm on my knees and I need to know
Repeat Bridge 2x
And I'm so tired of being wrong all the time
I need some assurance in my life,
That's why I'm so glad Lord,
That you've told me what I need to know
Ending
You've told me,
That it's your face, that I'll see when I wake,
That it's your hands, that will pull me through
It's your eyes, that I'll see when I reach the end.
When I reach the end, you've told me,
That you're there
