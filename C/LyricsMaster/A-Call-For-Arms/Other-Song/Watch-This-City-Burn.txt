This will never die
I will never learn
Drown inside these flames
Watch this city burn
This will never die, I will never learn, drown inside these flames watch this city burn, burn
You will never silence me; I've got something to say
You will never silence me; I've got something to say
Your history has been whitewashed
You will never silence me; I've got something to say
You will never silence me; I've got something to say
It's not what you can do for your country; it's how you can burn your fucking country to the ground
You will never silence me; I've got something to say
