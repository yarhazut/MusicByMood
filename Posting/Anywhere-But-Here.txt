Waking up again, shaking off the strange
They plug into your mind as they're whispering your name
Colors form as you open up your eyes
Anywhere but here, you run to save your life
Into the sun again, I never could pretend
Into the sun again, in this state of grace
Your future's waiting at the gate now
They tell your more than anyone could say
At the very end of every thing there is a place
Sleep now, forever letting go
Lightning in a bottle, straight into the core
Into the sun again, I never could pretend
Into the sun again, in this state of grace
Your future's waiting at the gate now
Where is everybody?
Into the sun again, I never could pretend
Into the sun again, in this state of grace
Your future's waiting at the gate now
Into the sun again, I never could pretend
Into the sun again, in this state of grace
Your future's waiting at the gate now
